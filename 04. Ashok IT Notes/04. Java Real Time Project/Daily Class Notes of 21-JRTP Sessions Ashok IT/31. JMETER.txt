==========
JMETER
==========

-> JMETER is a free & open source software given by Apache Organization

-> JMETER is used for performance testing

-> Performance testing means the process of verifying stability & responsiveness of the application

-> How our application is responding for different work loads we can verify using JMETER

-> Using JMETER we can create virtual users to test our application performance

-> JMETER is a java based desktop application

-> Using JMETER we can test performance of any web application

Note: We can't implement performance testing manually


What is the response time of our application for 100 users ?
What is the response time of our application for 200 users ?
What is the response time of our application for 300 users ?
What is the response time of our application for 400 users ?
What is the response time of our application for 1000 users ?

-> We need to provide application performance details to client

-> If application performance is slow then we need to troubleshoot the issue and we need to fix it.


==============
JMETER Setup
===============

1) Download JMETER software 

URL : https://dlcdn.apache.org//jmeter/binaries/apache-jmeter-5.5.zip

2) Extract JMETER zip file

3) Goto JMETER bin folder and run "jmeter.bat" file  (it will open JMETER tool)


=================
Creating Test Plan
=================

1) Right Click on Test plan

			- Add Threads 
			- Add Thread Group
			- Enter Thread/users count  

2) Right Click on Thread Group   (For sampler)

			- Add Sampler
				- Http Request
				- Add Server IP, Port Number, URL Pattern

3) Right Click on Thread Group (For Listerns)

			- Add Listener
				- Add View Results Tree
				- Add Summary Report
			

4) Save the test and run the test

5) Verify the results (we can change thread group count and we can test it)




==================
JMETER Best Practise
==================

-> Create the TEST in GUI mode and run the test in CLI mode


    Cmd to execute the test ::::   jmeter -n -t test-plan.jmx -l test-results.jtl

-> After test execution complete we can import JTL file into JMETER summary report to see the test results.

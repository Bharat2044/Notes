Extensible:-   Python Programming Provides Its Module Services to Other language 
                       Programmers for easy to use by writing Less Code with More Meaning.
		       Since Python Programming Provides Its Services to Other languages and hence Python is One of The Extensible Programming Lang.


Embedded: Python Programming will use Other language  Services / Libraries also. In 
                    Otherwords, we cal call Other language code inside of Python Program and Hence Python Programing Lang is Embedded Programming Lang.

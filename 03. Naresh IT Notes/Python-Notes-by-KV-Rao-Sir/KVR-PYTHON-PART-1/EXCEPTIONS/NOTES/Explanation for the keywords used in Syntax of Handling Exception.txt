			Explanation for the keywords used in Syntax of Handling Exception
		================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.try
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>It is the block in which we write block of statements generating exceptions. In otherwords what 
    are all the statements generating exceptions, those statements must be written within try block and hence try block is called Exception monitering block.
=>When an exception occurs in try block then PVM comes out of try block and executes  appropriate except block.
=>After executing appropriate except block, PVM never goes to try block for executing rest of the statements in try block.
=>Every try block must be immediately followed by except block ( Otherwise we get   SyntaxError)
=>Every try block must contain atleast one except block . It is recommended to write multiple 
     except blocks for generating User-Friendly error messages.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.except
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>It is the block in which we write block of statements generates User-Friendly Error Friendly  Messages. In Otherwords except block suppreses Technical error messages and generates User-Freindly Error Messages and hence except block is called Exception Processing Block.
Note: Handling exception= try block + except  block
=>except block will execute when there is an exception occurs in try block.
=>Even we write multiple except blocks , PVM executes Appropriate except block(Single Block) depends on type of exception occurs in try block.
=>The place for writing except block is that after try block and before else block.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.else 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>It is the block in which we write block of statements will display results of the program and hence else block is called Result Generated Block.
=>else block will execute when there is no exception occurs in try block.
=>Writing else block is optional
=>The place of writing else block is that after except block and before finally block (if it present).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.finally 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>It is the block, in which we write block of statements will relinquish (release / close / give-up/clean-up) the resources ( Files, Database softwares) which are obtained in try block and finally block is called Resouces  relinquishing Block.
=>finally block will execute compulsorily.
=>finally block is optional to write
=>The place of writing finally block is that after else block ( if else block present)

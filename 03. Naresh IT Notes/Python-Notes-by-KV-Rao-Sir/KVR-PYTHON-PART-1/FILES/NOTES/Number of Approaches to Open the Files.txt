					Number of Approaches to Open the Files
			=========================================================
=>In Python Programming, we have Two Approaches to Open the File. They are

			1. By using open()
			2. By using " with open() as "
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. By using open()
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:     varname=open("File Name","File Mode")
------------------
Explanation
------------------
=>Here Varname Represents File pointer which will point to the Opened File and whose type is 
    <class, _io.TextIOWrapper>.
=>open() is used for Opening the File in Specified File Mode
=>FileName Represents Name of the File to be specified by the Programmer
=>File Mode Represents any one of the File Opening Modes ( r,w,a,r+,w+,a+,x,x+)
=>Once we open any file name with open() then we must close the File by using close() and It is  mandatory for maintaining  Consistency of Data(Manual Closing--- there is no concept of Auto-Closeability).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. By using " with open() as "
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:       with  open("File Name","File Mode") as varname:

Explanation
************************
=>Here "with" and "as" are the Keywords.
=>Here Varname Represents File pointer which will point to the Opened File and whose type is 
    <class, _io.TextIOWrapper>.
=>open() is used for Opening the File in Specified File Mode
=>FileName Represents Name of the File to be specified by the Programmer
=>File Mode Represents any one of the File Opening Modes ( r,w,a,r+,w+,a+,x,x+)
=>The execution Process of "with open(---) as " is that "As Long as PVM present in side of " with open(---) as " Indentation then File Name is actively Available and once PVM comes out of " with open(---) as" Indentation then File name closed Automatically and This Facility is Called Auto-Closeability of File". No Need to close the  file by using close() manually.

						 Inheritance 
		=================================================
=>Inhenritance is one of distinct features of OOPs
=>The purpose of Inheritance is that " To build Re-usable Applications with Effective Memmory Management in Python Object Oriented  Programming".
-----------------------------------------
=>Definition of Inheritance:
-----------------------------------------
=>The Process obtaining Data members , Methods and Constructors (Features ) of one class   into  another class is called Inheritance.
=>The class which is giving Data members , Methods and Constructors (Features ) is called  Super or  Base or Parent Class.
=>The Class which is taking Data members , Methods and Constructors (Features ) is called  Sub or  Derived or Child Class.
=>The Inheritance concept always follows Logical OR Virtual  Memory Management. This Memory Management says that " Neither we write Source Code nor Takes Physical Memory Space ".
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advatnages of Inheritance:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>When we develop any inheritance based application, we get the following advantages.
		1. Application Development Time is Less
		2. Application Memory Space is Less
		3. Application Execution time is Fast / Less 
		4. Application Performance is enhanced (Improved )
		5. Redundency (Duplication ) of the code is minimized.

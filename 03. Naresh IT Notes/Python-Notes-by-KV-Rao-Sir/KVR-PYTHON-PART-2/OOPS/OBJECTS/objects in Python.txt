	===================================================
				objects in Python
	===================================================
=>When we define a class, memory space is not created for Data Members and Methods but whose memory is created when we create an object w.r.t class name.
=>The Purpose of creating an object is that "To store Data".
=>To do any Data Processing, It is mandatory to create an object. 
=>To create an object, there must exists a class Definition otherwise we get NameError.

Definition of object:
-----------------------------------
=>Instance of a class is called object ( Instance is nothing but allocating sufficient memory space for the Data Members and Methods of a class).
-------------------------------------------------
Syntax for creating an object
-------------------------------------------------
			  varname=classname()                                 
				(or)
			 varname=classname(Val1,Val2...Val-n)            

Examples:  create an object of Student
			
			so=Student()
Example:-  create an object Employee

			eo=Employee(10,"Rossum")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Differences Between Classes and Objects
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class:
------------
1) A class is a collection of Data Members and Methods
2) When we define a class, memory space is not created for Data Members and Methods and it can be treated as  specification / model for real time application.
3) Definition of a perticular class exists only once
4) When we develop any Program with OOPs principles, Class Definition  Loaded First  in main memory only once.
---------------
Objects:
--------------
1) Instance of a class is called Object
2) When we create an object, we get the memory space for Data members and Methods of Class.
3) w.r.t One class Definition, we can create multiple objects.
4) we can create an object after loading the class definition otherwise we get    NameError

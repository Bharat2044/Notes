				Real Time Applications Developed with PYTHON Programming
		====================================================================
=>By Using PYTHON Programming with Various Combined Modules, we can develop the following Real Time Applications.

		
		1. Development of WEB APPLICATIONS(Web Sites)
				a) Java Programming Language-->Tech-->Servlets,JSP,JDBC,Hibernet,Spring, Spring with Micro Services
					(SUN MS--->Oracle Corp)
				b) C#.Net Programming Language---->Tech--->ASP.NET, Micro Services...etc
					(Microsoft )
				c) PYTHON Programming Language---->Tech---->Django OR Flask OR Bottle OR Pyramid
				     bcoz writing the code in Python in Very Easy due Rich set of Existing Modules
				     Less Lines of Code and More Meaning 
				
		2. Development of Gaming Applications.
		3. Development of Artificial Intelligence Applications (Scikit,Scipy, nlp, nlkt....etc)
						a) Machnine Leaning
						b) Deep Learning
		4. Development of Image Processing Applications(opencv)
		5. Development of Audio and Video Applications
		6. Development of Web Scrapping OR Web Harvesting
		7. Development of Business Applications (Bussiness Apps)
		8. Development of Scientific Application (NASA)
		9. Development of Software Projects 
		10.Development of OS Installers

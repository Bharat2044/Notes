			Introduction to Thread Based Applications
		=========================================
=>The purpose of multi threading is that "To provide Concurrent / Simultaneous execution / Paralllel Execution".
=>Concurrent  Execution is nothing but executing the operations all at once.
=>The advantage of Concurrent  execution is that to get less execution time.
=>If a Python Program contains multiple threads then it is called Multi Threading program.
--------------------------
=>Def. of thread:
--------------------------
=>A Flow of Control is called thread.
=>The purpose of thread is that "To Perform certain operation whose logic  developed in Functions / Methods  concurently."
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>By default Every Python contains Single Thread and whose name is "MainThread" and It provides Sequential Execution.
=>Programtically, In a Python Program we can create multiple sub  / Child  threads  and whose purpose is that "To execute operations whose logic is written in Functions / Methods Concurrently ".
=>Hence Programatically a Python Program contains two types of Threads. They are
		a) MainThread
		b) Sub / Child Threads
=>MainThread is created / Initiated  by PVM ,when program exeuction starts and the role  of mainThread is to execute main program statements and Monitor the exeuction status of Sub threads(if sub threads present).
=>The Sub / Child Threads always executes operations whose logic is written in Functions / Methods Concurrently ".

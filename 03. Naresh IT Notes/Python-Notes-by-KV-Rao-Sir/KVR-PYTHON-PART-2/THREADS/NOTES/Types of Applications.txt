		============================================
				Types of Applications in Multi Threading
		============================================
=>The Purpose of Multi Threading is that "To Provide Concurrent Execution / Simultaneous Execxition Or Parallel Processing(executing all at once )."
=>In Industry , we have two types of Applications / languages. They are

			1. Process Based Applications
			2. Thread Based Applications.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Process Based Applications
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>Process Based Applications contains Single Thread
=>Process Based Applications Provides Sequential  Execution
=>Process Based Applications Takes More Exeution Time
=>Process Based Applications are treated as Heavy Weight Components.
Examples:   C,CPP.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Thread Based Applications
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>Thread Based Applications contains by Default Single Thread and Programtically we can   create  Multiple Threads.
=>Thread Based Applications Provides Both  Sequential  Execution and Concurrent  Execution.
=>Thread Based Applications Takes Less Exeution Time
=>Thread Based Applications are treated as Light Weight Components.

=>Examples:  Python, Java, C#.net...etc

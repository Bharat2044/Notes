						     Timer Events

setTimeOut()
clearTimeOut()
setInterval()
clearInterval()

setTimeOut():
- It is a timer event used to control "bounce" in devices that use keyboard. 
- Bounce is a mechanism where task is loaded into memory and released immediately into process. 
- setTimeOut() can de-bounce. It can lock the task in memory for a specific duration of time and release into process. 

Syntax:
	setTimeOut(function(){ }, interval);

clearTimeOut():
- It is a timer event uses to remove a task from memory before it is released into process. 
- It requires a memory reference where the task is loaded. 

Syntax:
	clearTimeOut(referenceName);


							  useRef()

- It a new hook into React 17x versions.
- It is used to create a memory reference, which is intended for process.
- You can configure reference memory to store a value or function, which is used internally in the process and not for presentation. 

Syntax:
	  let  refName =  useRef(null);

	  refName.current = value / function(){};

- "current" is a property that refers to current thread process. 

Ex: 
timeout-demo.jsx

import { useRef, useState } from "react"


export  function TimeoutDemo(){

    const [msg, setMsg] = useState('');

    let thread2 = useRef(null);

    function Msg1(){
        setMsg('Hello !');
    }
    function Msg2(){
        setMsg('How are you?');
    }
    function Msg3(){
        setMsg('Welcome to React');
    }

    
    function handleClick(){
         setTimeout(Msg1, 3000);
         thread2.current = setTimeout(Msg2, 6000);
         setTimeout(Msg3, 10000);
    }

    function handleCancelClick(){
        clearTimeout(thread2.current);
    }

    return(
        <div className="container-fluid">
            <button onClick={handleClick} className="btn btn-primary mt-2">Display Messages</button>
            <button onClick={handleCancelClick} className="btn btn-danger mt-2 ms-1">Cancel Message 2</button>
            <p className="fs-4 text-center">{msg}</p>
        </div>
    )
}

setInterval():
- It is a timer event used to load task into memory and release a copy of task into process.
- It performs the task repeatedly at regular time intervals, until removed from memory.

Syntax:
	setInterval(function(){}, interval);

clearInterval():
- It removes the task from memory, which is using the reference of setInterval.

Syntax:
	clearInterval(referenceName);

Create a VPC CIDR = 192.168.0.0/16
Create internet gateway and attach it to the VPC
Create 2 subnets,
  --> Public Subnet = 192.168.1.0/24
  --> Private Subnet = 192.168.2.0/24

Create NAT gateway(assign the EIP) and put it in Public Subnet
Create Route tables
  --> Public RT -->Routes --> Edit --> Add Route --> 0.0.0.0/0 Routing to IGW --> Public Subnet should be asscoaited
  --> Private RT -->Routes --> Edit --> Add Route --> 0.0.0.0/0 Routing to NAT --> Private Subnet should be associated

Create a new Security Group and allow SSH/22
Launch 1 EC2 instance(Bastion/Jump Server) in Public subnet: This can be connected from internet
launch 1 EC2 intance in Private subnet(Amazon Linux which has CLI already installed): This cannot be connected from Internet
Enable DNS hostname from VPC --> Actions --> Enable DNS hostname
If you want to connect to Private server--> First connect to jump server and then connect to the Private server
--> sudo -s
--> create a pem file on the bastion server vi 9AMBATCH.pem --> Enter --> PRess i --> paste the code of pem file here --> esc -->wq!
--> chmod 400 xxxxBATCH.pem
--> ssh -i "xxxxBATCH.pem" ec2-user@192.168.2.28



VPC ENDPOINTS
**************
Login to the Private server thorugh Bastion Server
Check the AWS Cli version or install AWS CLI
aws --version
Create a role with EC2 as trusted and provide S3 permissions
Attach the role to the EC2 instance
aws s3 ls
aws s3 mb s3://endpointdemobkt (This will work because NAT Route is available on Private RT)
Remove the NAT Route from Private RT
Access aws s3 ls (This will not work because you have removed the NAT route from private RT)
Create a VPC Endpoint ---> Select S3 endpoint --> Select Mumbai VPC --> SEelct Private RT --> Create
Check the route after creating the endpoint on private RT(The endpoint routes is automatically created)
Now access aws s3 ls on private server (This should work now because VPC Endpoints are configured)
You cannot access normal internet with VPC endpoint. Only AWS services can be accessed with the VPC Endpoint

VPC Peering
***********
Create Mumbai and Ireland Infrastructure
Create a VPC Peering in Mumbai region (requester is Mumbai and accepter is Ireland VPC ID)
Accept the VPC peering in Ireland Region
Add a route in Mumbai Private RT as 192.169.0.0/16 --> Peering Connection
Add a route in Ireland Private RT as 192.168.0.0/16 --> Peering Connection
Add a new rule to the Mumbai SG as SSH --> 192.169.0.0/16
Add a new rule to the Ireland SG as SSH --> 192.168.0.0/16

Login to the Mumbai bastion --> SSH to Mumbai Private Server --> SSH to Ireland Private server



Deleting the VPC
--> Delete the buckets
--> Delete Endpoints
--> Delete the NAT first
--> Delete VPC Peering
--> Terminate the EC2 instances
--> Delete the Mumbai VPC 
--> Release EIP

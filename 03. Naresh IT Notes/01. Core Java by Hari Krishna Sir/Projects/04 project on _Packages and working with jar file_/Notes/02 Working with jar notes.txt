	What is jar file, why jar ?
	-----------------------------
	- Jar file is a compressed file contains packages(folders), classes and interfaces

	- It is used for grouping all pacakges of a software or project as one file 
		for easy maintaining and distributing to other programmers of same company
			or to the programmers of other company accross the world.
	
	Diff b/w zip and jar file
	-----------------------------
	- Like zip/rar it is also a compressed file.
	- It is a platform independent compressed file. 
	- It will work in all operating systems.
	- It is specific to only Java and its related technologies and framewoks. 
	- The extension of this file is ".jar"
		
	How can we access the packages and classes availabe in jar file
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- For accessing packages available in a jar file, we must set classpath with this jar file path
		we must include jar file name in classpath

	- By default jar files are placed in "lib" folder in every software
		so we must include lib\jar file path in classpath

	Predefined jar files of JDK, oracle and server softwares
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
		- jdk all packages and classes are given in "rt.jar" file
				in JDK software

		- oracle jdbc driver all packages and classes are given in "ojdbc7.jar" file 
				in Oracle software 

		- servlet technology all packages and classes are given in "servlet-api.jar" file and 
		- jsp technology all packages and classes are given in "jsp-api.jar" file 
				in tomcat/weblogic/websphear server software

		- In order to access oracle driver api , servlet api, jsp api from our classes 
			we must place those jar files in classpath
		
		- Note: By default jar files are placed in "lib" folder in every software
				so we must include lib\jar file path in classpath

		- Rule: When you create classpath, we must include ".;" in classpath value at beginning
				otherwise the class available in PWD are found and executed

	Setting classpath temporarily from command prompt	
	-----------------------------------------------------------------
		cmd>set 
		classpath=.;C:\jdk1.8.0_144\lib\tools.jar;C:\jdk1.8.0_144\jre\lib\rt.jar;C:\app\HK\product\12.1.0\dbhome_1\jdbc\li
		b\ojdbc7.jar;C:\apache-tomcat-9.0.20\lib\servlet-api.jar;C:\apache-tomcat-9.0.20\lib\jsp-api.jar

	- Note: JDK tools.jar and rt.jar file no need to place in classpath, 
			because jdk tools javac, java and etc.. tools can find 
			the packages and classes available in rt.jar automatically.

			But we must set classpath for other software jar files
	

	- Can we include .class file in classpath, a package in classpath and a jar file in classpath?
		We must not place ".class" file name and "package name" in classpath
			we must place only uptop their parent directory name

		but we must palce "jar" file name in classpath


	Creating jar file for our project classes
	----------------------------------------------
	- for creating a jar file we must use JDK tool "jar" command
	- jar creates an archive for classes and resources(files), and can manipulate or
		restore individual classes or resources from an archive.

	- jar command has several options to create jar file and working with it
		1) -c, --create               Meant for creating the archive/jar file
		2) -f, --file=FILE         Meant for specifing the jar file name to create 
		3) -v, --verbose            Meant for displaying all file names those are storing in jar file name

		4) -t, --list		     Meant for Listing/displaying the table of contents/file name for the archive
		5) -u, --update              Meant for Updating an existing jar archive
		6) -x, --extract              Extract named (or all) files from the archive


	- syntax to create jar command 
		cmd>jar	-cvf	 <jar file name>   <files and folder names with space separator>  
				-- the specified files and directories are stoed in this jar file

		cmd>jar	-cvf	 <jar file name>   *
				-- all files and directories available in PWD are stoted in this jar file

		cmd>jar	-cvf	 <jar file name>   *.class
				-- all .class files available in PWD are stored in this jar file


		project
			|-> A.java
			|-> A.class
			|-> B.java
			|-> B.class
			|-> C.java
			|-> C.class

		cmd> jar   -cvf  test.jar  A.class   B.class

		cmd> jar   -cvf  test.jar  *

Types of jar files
--------------------
We have two types of jar files
	1) API jar file (library jar file)
	2) Executable jar file

- A jar file that contains packages and classes with some functionality methods 
	for reusing by other programmer is called API/library jar file
		For example:
			- rt.jar, ojdbc7.jar, servlet-api.jar, jsp-api.jar -> API jar files
			- classes.jar file with Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, etc... logic classes is API jar file

- A jar file that can be executed by java command is called executable jar file
	In this jar file must have main method class and must place 
	this main method class name in MANIFEST.MF file in this jar file
	by using the property name MAIN-CLASS

	For example:
			- a main.jar that constians Calc.class file with main method is called executable jar file

How can we create an executable jar file?
--------------------------------------------------
- By default every jar file is not an executable jar file.
- To make a jar fiel as an executable jar file 
	in MANIFEST.MF file we must add one property 
		"Main-Class" with "main method class name" 
	inside jar file  in META-INF folder
- Then only this jar file will be an executable jar file

What is MANIFEST.MF file?
------------------------------------
- This file is part of a jar file, it is automatically created by jar command in every jar file
- It is a properties files that contains several properties information of this jar file
- A property is nothing but a (name, value) pair

	For example:
		name	value
		  sno		 101			<- property 1	
		  sname	 HK			<- property 2

- In a properties file a property name and value are differentiated by using "="
- Each prooperty is differentiated by using new line, that we must place every property in the separate line
- In MANIFEST.MF file, we must place properties with predefined names, 
	but not with our own name, beacause those properties are reading by java command at execution time,
	java command does not know our own properties names.
	
	For example:
		for place main method class name we must use the property
			MAIN-Class: main method class name with FQN(<package name>.<class name>)


Creating an executable jar file with Test.class without package
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)	executableJar
		|- Test.java
	
2)	executableJar>javac Test.java
			
		executableJar
			|- Test.class
			|- Test.java

3)	executableJar>jar  -cvfe  main.jar   Test   Test.class
		
		executableJar
			|- Test.class
			|- Test.java
			|- main.jar
				|- Test.class
				|- META-INF
					|- MANIFEST.MF
						Main-Class: Test

4)	executableJar>java  -jar  main.jar
		- java command reads main method class name from MANIFEST.MF file
		- executes Test.class file available in main.jar 
		- displays output "Hello, World!"
	
Creating an executable jar file with Test.class with package
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)	executableJar
		|- p1
		     |-	Test.java
	
2)	executableJar>javac  p1\Test.java
			
		executableJar
			|- p1
				|- Test.class
				|- Test.java

3)	executableJar>jar  -cvfe  main.jar   p1.Test   p1\Test.class
		
		executableJar
			|- p1
				|- Test.class
				|- Test.java
			|- main.jar
				|- p1
					|- Test.class
				|- META-INF
					|- MANIFEST.MF
						Main-Class: p1.Test

4)	executableJar>java  -jar  main.jar
		- java command reads main method class name "p1.Test" from MANIFEST.MF file
		- executes Test.class file available in p1 package in this main.jar 
		- displays output "Hello, World!"
	

	
Creating an executable jar file with multiple classes and multiple packages
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)	executableJar
		+---p1
		¦		
		¦		A.java
		¦
		+---p2
			
				Test.java
		


2)	executableJar>javac  p2\Test.java
			
		executableJar
			+---p1
			¦		A.class
			¦		A.java
			¦
			+---p2
					Test.class
					Test.java
			
3)	executableJar>jar  -cvfe  main.jar   p2.Test   p2\Test.class
		
		executableJar
			+---p1
			¦		A.class
			¦		A.java
			¦
			+---p2
			¦		Test.class
			¦		Test.java
			¦
			+---main.jar
					|- p1
						|- A.class
					|- p2
						|- Test.class
					|- META-INF
						|- MANIFEST.MF
							Main-Class: p2.Test

4)	executableJar>java  -jar  main.jar
		- java command reads main method class name "p2.Test" from MANIFEST.MF file
		- executes Test.class file available in p2 package with A.class available in p1 pakcage in this main.jar 
		- displays output 
			Test main start
			A m1
			Test main end
	


	
Creating an executable jar file with api jar file with project scenario
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project
	Developer
		+---bin
		+---dist
		+---lib
		+---src
				+---p1
							A.java

	project\Developer>javac -d bin src\p1\A.java

		Developer
			+---bin
			¦		+---p1
			¦				A.class
			¦
			+---dist
			+---lib
			+---src
					+---p1
							A.java

	project\Developer> cd dist
	project\Developer\dist>jar -cvf  classes.jar  -C ..\bin .
		Developer
			+---bin
			¦		+---p1
			¦				A.class
			¦
			+---dist
			¦				classes.jar
			¦
			+---lib
			+---src
					+---p1
							A.java

	- Share the api jar file classes.jar file to user programmer
	- Then user programmer places classes.jar in lib in his project folder
//==============================================================
Project 
	User
	+---bin
	+---dist
	+---lib
	¦			classes.jar
	¦
	+---src
			+---p2
					 Test.java
	
	Proejct\User>javac -d bin src\p2\Test.java
		error: package p1 is not found
		error: can not found symbol class A

	Proejct\User>set classpath=.;lib\classes.jar

	Proejct\User>javac -d bin src\p2\Test.java
		User
		+---bin
		¦		+---p2
		¦				Test.class
		¦
		+---dist
		+---lib
		¦			 classes.jar
		¦
		+---src
				+---p2
						Test.java

	Proejct\User>java p2.Test
		Exception in java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: p2.Test

	Proejct\User>set classpath=%classpath%;bin
	Proejct\User>java p2.Test
		Test main start
		A m1
		Test main end

//working with executable jar file
	Proejct\User>jar -cvfe main.jar p2.Test -C bin .
	Proejct\User>java -jar main.jar
		Exception java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: p1.A

	Note: When we run a class from jar file, java command does not use classpath 
			value from set classpath or permanent classpath value
		
			We must set classpath inside jar file in MANIFEST.MF file


				Manual work for adding classpath in MANIFEST.MF file
				---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
					1) Open main.jar file by using winrar/winzip software
					2) Open MANIFEST.MF file using any editor software (notepad/editplus
						- If it is not working, extract MANIFEST.MF file from main.jar file to folder,
					3) Add the property 
						Class-Path: lib\classes.jar
					4) Save it -> click Save button on winrar software
						- If you extracted and editted, copy MANIFEST.MF file into main.jar file
						- Click save 
			Not execute main.jar 

	Proejct\User>java -jar main.jar
		Test main start
		A m1
		Test main end

			Adding properties in MANIFEST.MF file through command
			-----------------------------------------------------------------------
			1) You youself create MANIFEST.MF by using editor software
			2) In this file from editor software add the properties you need
			3) Save it in current project working directory
			4) Run below command for copying the properties 
				from your MANIFEST.MF file to the MANIFEST.MF file available in jar file

			
				User>jar --create --file --verbose main.jar   --manifest mymanifest.mf   -C bin/ .

			Rule: We must place one empty new line at end of the file

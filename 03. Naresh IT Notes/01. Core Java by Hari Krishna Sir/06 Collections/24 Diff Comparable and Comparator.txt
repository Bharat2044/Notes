//Diff b/w Comparable and Comparator?
/*
 * 1) 
 * 	Comparable is used for providing natural sorting order
 *  Comparator is used for providing custom sorting order
 *  
 * 2) 
 *  Comparable contains compareTo(Object) param method 
 * 		for providing objects comparison logic
 *  Comparator contains compare(Object, Object) param method
 * 		for providing objects comparison logic
 * 
 * 3)
 *  By default TS.add(-) invokes Comparable.compareTo(-) method
 *  	when we are adding objects
 *  TS.add(-) methods invokes Comparator.compare(O, O) only
 *  	when we pass it as argument explicitly by using TreeSet(Comparator) constructor
 *   
 * 4)
 * 	Comparable is available in java.lang package since Java 1.2v
 * 	Comparator is available in java.util package since Java 1.2v
 * 
 * 5) 
 * 	Both interfaces are functional interfaces(SAM interface)
 *  but Comparable is not explicitly declared buy using @FunctionalInterface annotation
 *  whereas Comparator is declared with @FunctionalInterface annotation 
 *  because Comparable is not used as method or constructor parameter for passing 
 *  its implementation class instances.
 *    	 
 * 6) 
 *  Comparable interface has only one method that is compareTo(-)
 *  	It does not have any additional Java 8v default or static or private methods
 *  But in Comparator interface,  in addition to compare(-, -) method
 *  	it has another abstract method equals(Object) and 
 *  	several Java 8v default and static methods
 *  
 *

//Q) How many ways we can develop custom comparator?
//Q) What are different ways we provide implementation to comparator interface?
	/*
	 * We can provide implementation to Comparator interface in 4 ways
	 *		1) by using explicit outer class
	 *      2) by using Anonymous inner class
	 *      3) by using Lambda expression
	 *      4) by using Method reference
	 */ 

Case #1: Develop custom comparator to store B class objects 
			in ASC order based on property Y value by using explicit outer class approach

Case #2: Develop custom comparator to store B class objects 
			in Descending order based on property Y value by using Anonymous inner class

Case #2: Develop custom comparator to store B class objects 
			in Ascending order based on property Y value by using LE

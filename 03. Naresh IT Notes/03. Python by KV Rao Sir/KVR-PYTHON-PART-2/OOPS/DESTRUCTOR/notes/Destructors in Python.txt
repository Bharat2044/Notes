				Destructors in Python
				    and 
				Garbage Collector
		======================================
=>We know that Garbage Collector is one of the in-built program in python, which is running behind of every python program and whose is role is to collect un-used memory space and it improves the performance of python based applications.
=>Every Garbage Collector Program is internally   calling its Own Destructor Functions.
=>The destructor function  name in python is   def  __del__(self).
=>By default ,The destructor always called by Garbage Collector  when the program execution completed  for de-allocating the memory space of objects which are used in that program. Where as constructor called By PVM implicitly during object is creation for initlizing the object.

=>When the program execution is completed, GC calls its own destructor to de-allocate the memory space of objects present in program and it is called automatic Garbage Collection.

=>Hence , We have THREE programming  conditions for calling GC  and  to make the garbage collector to call destructor Function.

a) By default (or) automatically  GC calls destructor, when the program execution completed(called automatic Garbage Collection).
b) Make the object reference as None  for calling Forcefull Garbage Collection( called Forcefull Garbage Collection)
				Syntax :   objname=None
c) delete the object by using del operator  for calling Forcefull Garbage Collection(Called Forcefull Garbage Collection)
					Syntax:-   del  objname

-----------------
=>Syntax:
-----------------
		def       __del__(self):
		           -----------------------
			   -----------------------
=>No Need to write destructor in class of Python bcoz GC contains its own Destructor 
=======================================================================
				Garbage Collector
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>Garbage Collector contains a pre-defined module called "gc"
=>Here gc contains the following  Functions.
			
			1) isenabled()
			2) enable()
			3) disable()
=>GC is not under the control of Programmer but it always maintained and mangaged by OS and PVM.
NOTE: Python Programmers need not to write destructor method / function and need not 
            to deal with Garbage Collection Process by using gc module bcoz PVM and OS takes care about Automatic Garbage Collection Process by automatic enabling GC

					5. Bitwise Complement Operator ( ~ )
			================================================================

=>Syntax:      varname= ~Given Number
=>The execution process of Bitwise Complement Operator ( ~ ) is that " It Inverts the given bits".
=>Inverting the bits is nothing but 1 becomes 0 and 0 becomes 1
=>The formula for Bitwise Complement Operator ( ~ ) is given bellow
				 ~Given Number =  - ( Given Number + 1)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example1:
--------------------
>>> a=10
>>> print(~a)--------------      -11
>>> a=100
>>> print(~a)-----------------   -101
-----------------
>>> a=-123
>>> print(~a)-----------------  122
=============================================================================================
Q) Prove that  ~10 is -11
=============================================================================================
Proof : Given  ~10 =  -11
		Here -11 is the Opposite counter part of 11
=>Given Number  10 and Whose Binary Part is   1010
=> ~10 ----------------- ~(1010) =   0101 (Which is the Binary form of -11 which is the 2's complement of 11)
NOTE: All the Negative Numbers are 2's Complement of Their +Ve Numbers
[Example:   10 whose Counter part is -10--which is 2 's complement of 10]
------------------------------------
=>Here -11 is the Opposite counter part of 11 (2's complement of 11 )
=>All Negative Number stored in Main Memory in the form 2's Complement (2's complement= 1's complement+1)
-------------------------------------------------------
=>Here we Take 11 and whose Binary form is   1 0 1 1	
		(1's Complement of any Number= 1 becomes 0 and 0 becomes 1)
=>1's Complement of 11 is----------------------------0 1  0 0     
=>2's Complement of 11 is----------------------------1's Complement of 11 + 1
									=> 0100
									 =>0001 Binary Addition Rules (0+0=0, 1+0=1, 0+1=1 , 1+1= 0 with carry 1 )
									 --------------
									     0101----which is 2's Complement of 11 --result is  -11
									------------------
=============================================================================================
Q) Prove that  ~16 is -17
=============================================================================================
Proof : Given  ~16 =  -17
		Here -17 is the Opposite counter part of 17
=>Given Number  16 and Whose Binary Part is   0001  0000
=> ~16 ----------------- ~(0001  0000) =   1110 1111 (Which is the Binary form of -17)
---------------------------------------------------------
=>Here -17 is the Opposite counter part of 17
=>All Negative Number stored in Main Memory in the form 2's Complement (2's complement= 1's complement+1)
-------------------------------------------------------
=>Here we Take 17 and whose Binary form is   0001 0001
	(1's Complement of any Number= 1 becomes 0 and 0 becomes 1)
=>1's Complement of 17 is----------------------------1110  1110
=>2's Complement of 17 is----------------------------1's Complement of 17 + 1
								=>	1110  1110
									0000  0001 Binary Addition Rules ( (0+0=0,1+0=1, 0+1=1,1+1= 0 with carry 1 )
									------------------
									1110	 1111  (Which is the Binary form of -17)

Q) Prove that  ~15 is -16
=============================================================================================
Proof : Given  ~15 =  -16
		Here -16 is the Opposite counter part of 16
=>Given Number  15 and Whose Binary Part is   0000  1111
=> ~15 ----------------- ~(0000  1111) =   1111 0000 (Which is the Binary form of -16)
---------------------------------------------------------
=>Here -16 is the Opposite counter part of 16
=>All Negative Number stored in Main Memory in the form 2's Complement (2's complement= 1's complement+1)
-------------------------------------------------------
=>Here we Take 16 and whose Binary form is   0001 0000
	(1's Complement of any Number= 1 becomes 0 and 0 becomes 1)
=>1's Complement of 16 is----------------------------1110  1111
=>2's Complement of 16 is----------------------------1's Complement of 16 + 1
								=>	1110  1111
									0000  0001    Binary Addition ( (0+0=0, 1+0=1, 0+1=1 , 1+1= 0 with carry 1 )
									------------------
									1111	 0000  (Which is the Binary form of -16)

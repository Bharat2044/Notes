			Python DataBase Communication ( PDBC )
		=============================================
=>Even we acheived the Data Persistency by using Files, Files has the following Limitations.
	
	1. Files of any language does not contain security bcoz Files are unable to provide security in  the form of User 
	     Name and  Password.
	2. Files are unable to store large amount of data
	3. File are differing  from One OS to another OS (Files are OS depenedent)
	4. Querying and Processing the data from Files is Very Complex  bcoz file data is 
	    organized w.r.t Indices and idenfying the indices is very complex.
	5. Files does not contain  Column Names (Except CSV Files) and complex to Process data

=>To Overcome the limitation of files and to acheive the Data Persistency, we must use the concept of any RDBMS DataBase Softwares ( Oracle, MYSQL, Mongo DB, DB2, SQL Server, Postgey SQL, SQLITE3...........etc).
		
		1. All RDBMS DataBase Softwares Provides Security bcoz RDBMS DataBase 
		    Softwares considers User names and Password.
		2. All RDBMS DataBase Softwares stores large amount of data Compared to Files
		3. All RDBMS DataBase Softwares Arch Remains Same on all types of OSes ( OS Independent)
		4. Querying and Processing the data from All RDBMS DataBase Softwares  is Very  Simple 
		     bcoz data of All RDBMS DataBase Softwares oranganized  records in the form  of Tables with Column Names.
		5. The Data Present in any RDBMS DataBase Softwares oranganized in the form of Tables    
		   with  Column Names makes the processing Easy.

=>If Python Program want to communicate with any RDBMS DataBase Softwares then we must use a PRE-DEFINED MODULE and such  PRE-DEFINED MODULE  does not exist in Python Software.
=>Some Third Party Software Vendors( Ex: "Anthony Tuininga")  developed a Module for Python Programmers to communicate with  RDBMS DataBase Softwares and placed in github and Third  Party Software Modules must be installed.
=>To install any Third  Party Software Modules in python , we use a tool called pip and it is present in C:\Users\KVR\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Scripts folder.

=>Syntax :   pip install   Module Name     (at any Windows command prompt)

=>If Python Program want to communicate with Oracle Database, then we must install 
    cx_Oracle Module OR oracledb Module
=>Examples :   pip   install   cx_Oracle  (upto Python 3.10)
			  pip  install  oracledb ( python 3.11 and higher)

=>If Python Program want to communicate with MySQL Database, then we must install 
    mysql-connector or  mysql-connector-python Module.

=>Examples :   pip   install   mysql-connector (at any Windows command prompt)
=>Examples :   pip   install   mysql-connector-python (at any Windows command prompt)

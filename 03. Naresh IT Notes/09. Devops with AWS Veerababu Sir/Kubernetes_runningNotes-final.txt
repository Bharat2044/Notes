----------------------------------- Kubernetes---------------------------------------------

Kubernetes is a container orchestration system that was initially designed by Google to help scale
containerized applications in the cloud. Kubernetes can manage the lifecycle of containers, creating and
destroying them depending on the needs of the application, as well as providing a host of other features.
Kubernetes has become one of the most discussed concepts in cloud-based application development,
and the rise of Kubernetes signals a shift in the way that applications are developed and deployed.
In general, Kubernetes is formed by a cluster of servers, called Nodes, each running Kubernetes agent
processes and communicating with one another. The Master Node contains a collection of processes
called the control plane that helps enact and maintain the desired state of the Kubernetes cluster, while
Worker Nodes are responsible for running the containers that form your applications and services.



## A Kubernetes cluster is composed of two separate planes:

Kubernetes control plane—manages Kubernetes clusters and the workloads running on them. Include components like the API Server, Scheduler, and Controller Manager.
Kubernetes Workernode that can run containerized workloads. Each node is managed by the kubelet, an agent that receives commands from the control plane. --

==============================================================
## Master Node or Control Node compomnents  ##


## API Server -------
Provides an API that serves as the front end of a Kubernetes control plane. It is responsible for handling external and internal requests—determining whether a request is valid and then processing it. The API can be accessed via the kubectl command-line interface or other tools like kubeadm, and via REST calls.

## Scheduler :------ 
This component is responsible for scheduling pods on specific nodes according to automated workflows and user defined conditions, which can include resource requests

## etcd :-----
A key-value database that contains data about your cluster state and configuration. Etcd is fault tolerant and distributed.

## Controller:-----
It receives information about the current state of the cluster and objects within it, and sends instructions to move the cluster towards the cluster operator’s desired state. 

====================================================================
## Worker Node Components ##

## kubelet: ----
Each node contains a kubelet, which is a small application that can communicate with the Kubernetes control plane. The kubelet is responsible for ensuring that containers specified in pod configuration are running on a specific node, and manages their lifecycle.. It executes the actions commanded by your control plane

## Kube Proxy :---
All compute nodes contain kube-proxy, a network proxy that facilitates Kubernetes networking services. It handles all network communications outside and inside the cluster, forwarding traffic or replying on the packet filtering layer of the operating system.

## Container Runtime Engine :---
Each node comes with a container runtime engine, which is responsible for running containers. Docker is a popular container runtime engine, but Kubernetes supports other runtimes that are compliant with Open Container Initiative, including CRI-O and rkt.

===============================================================================
##  CORE COmponents ##

#Nodes: ----
Nodes are physical or virtual machines that can run pods as part of a Kubernetes cluster. A cluster can scale up to 5000 nodes. To scale a cluster’s capacity, you can add more nodes.

#POD:--------

Pods—pods are the smallest unit provided by Kubernetes to manage containerized workloads.  A pod typically includes several containers, which together form a functional unit or microservice.

#Kuberentes Service#:

Kubernetes, a Service is a method for exposing a network application that is running as one or more Pods in your cluster.

git hub link for dervice files : https://github.com/CloudTechDevOps/Kubernetes/tree/main/day-3-services
--Types:

# ClusterIP : This is the default type for service in Kubernetes.

As indicated by its name, this is just an address that can be used inside the cluster.

# NodePort: A NodePort differs from the ClusterIP in the sense that it exposes a port in each Node.

When a NodePort is created, kube-proxy exposes a port in the range 30000-32767:

# LoadBlancer :

This service type creates load balancers in various Cloud providers like AWS, GCP, Azure, etc., to expose our application to the Internet.



##Kubernetes has several port configurations for Services:

#Port: the port on which the service is exposed. Other pods can communicate with it via this port.

#TargetPort: the actual port on which your container is deployed. The service sends requests to this port and the pod container must listen to the same port.

#NodePort: exposes a service externally to the cluster. So the application can be accessed via this port externally. By default, it’s automatically assigned during deployment.

========================================================================================================


## Horizonal Pod Auto Scaling ##


In Kubernetes, a HorizontalPodAutoscaler automatically updates a workload resource (such as a Deployment or StatefulSet), with the aim of automatically scaling the workload to match demand.

Horizontal scaling means that the response to increased load is to deploy more Pods. This is different from vertical scaling, which for Kubernetes would mean assigning more resources (for example: memory or CPU) to the Pods that are already running for the workload.

If the load decreases, and the number of Pods is above the configured minimum, the HorizontalPodAutoscaler instructs the workload resource (the Deployment, StatefulSet, or other similar resource) to scale back down.

# Metric Server deployment ##

The Kubernetes Metrics Server is an aggregator of resource usage data in your cluster, and it isn't deployed by default in Amazon EKS clusters.

we need to deploy by following process 

#Deploy the Metrics Server with the following command:

kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml


#Verify that the metrics-server deployment is running the desired number of Pods with the following command.
 
kubectl get deployment metrics-server -n kube-system

kubectl top pod # to see pod load

kubectl top node # to see node load 

-----------------------------------ingress-------------------------

What is an Ingress?
In Kubernetes, an Ingress is an object that allows access to your Kubernetes services from outside the Kubernetes cluster. You configure access by creating a collection of rules that define which inbound connections reach which services.

kubectl create namespace ingress-nginx # create name space for ingress-nginx

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.2.1/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml     ----to install ingress controller yaml

############# Resource and Request #############

In Kubernetes, you use resources and requests in your pod or container specifications to manage and allocate resources effectively. These settings help ensure that your applications have the necessary resources to run efficiently and that the cluster's resources are used optimally.

Kubernetes Pod Definition with Resource Requests and Limits
Here is an example YAML configuration for a Kubernetes pod that includes resource requests and limits for CPU and memory:

Pod.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: example-container
    image: nginx:latest
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: "50m"
        memory: "100Mi"
      limits:
        cpu: "100m"
        memory: "200Mi"

Explanation
apiVersion: The version of the Kubernetes API you're using.
kind: The type of Kubernetes resource. In this case, it's a Pod.
metadata: Metadata about the pod, including the name.
spec: The specification of the pod.
containers: A list of containers in the pod.
name: The name of the container.
image: The container image to run.

resources:
requests: The minimum amount of resources required for the container to start.
cpu: The requested CPU (50m means 50 milliCPU).
memory: The requested memory (100Mi means 100 Mebibytes).

limits: The maximum amount of resources the container is allowed to use.
cpu: The CPU limit (100m means 100 milliCPU).
memory: The memory limit (200Mi means 200 Mebibytes).



########## Image pull policy #####################

In Kubernetes, the imagePullPolicy is a field that determines when the kubelet should pull (download) the container image. There are three possible values for imagePullPolicy:

Always: The image will always be pulled from the registry.
IfNotPresent: The image will be pulled only if it is not already present on the node.
Never: The image will never be pulled; it is assumed to be present on the node.
If the imagePullPolicy is not explicitly set in a Kubernetes Pod specification, Kubernetes uses default behaviors based on the image tag:

If the image tag is latest, the default imagePullPolicy is Always.
For all other tags (including when no tag is specified, which implicitly uses the latest tag), the default imagePullPolicy is IfNotPresent.
Example Pod Specification
Here is an example of a pod specification that does not explicitly set the imagePullPolicy:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
    image: nginx
Default Behavior for imagePullPolicy When Not Present
If the image is nginx:latest or just nginx (implicitly nginx:latest):

The default imagePullPolicy will be Always.
If the image has a specific tag, e.g., nginx:1.19:

The default imagePullPolicy will be IfNotPresent.
Example with Specific imagePullPolicy
To explicitly set the imagePullPolicy, you can include it in the container specification:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
    image: nginx:1.19
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
Explicitly Setting imagePullPolicy
Here are examples for each policy:

Always:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
    image: nginx:1.19
    imagePullPolicy: Always
IfNotPresent:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
    image: nginx:1.19
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
Never:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
    image: nginx:1.19
    imagePullPolicy: Never
Summary
When imagePullPolicy is not specified, Kubernetes defaults to Always for images tagged as latest and IfNotPresent for other tags. Explicitly setting imagePullPolicy can help control image pull behavior and optimize deployment times and resource usage.


                    

 #################### schedule #####################

Schedulers 
 ## schedule ##

Scheduling overview
A scheduler watches for newly created Pods that have no Node assigned. For every Pod that the scheduler discovers, the scheduler becomes responsible for finding the best Node for that Pod to run on. The scheduler reaches this placement decision taking into account the scheduling principles described below.

1. Node Selector

2. Node affinity 

3. Daemonset

4. Taint and Toleration  


1.Nodeselector 

NodeSelector is the simplest recommended form of node selection constraint. You can add the nodeSelector field to your Pod specification and specify the node labels you want the target node to have. Kubernetes only schedules the Pod onto nodes that have each of the labels you specify.

# to label the node 
kubectl label nodes <node-name> <label-key>=<label-value>

Example: 

kubectl label nodes ip-192-168-6-173.ap-south-1.compute.internal size=Large


# to unlabel
kubectl label nodes <node-name> <label-key>=<label-value>-
kubectl label nodes ip-192-168-16-188.ap-south-1.compute.internal size-

# to list 

kubectl get nodes --show-labels

Labels are case sensitive  


Ex:Below Pod node selector 

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp
  labels:
      app: webapp
      type: front-end
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container 
    image: nginx
  nodeSelector:
    size: Large

A Kubernetes node selector is a simple way to constrain which nodes your pods can be scheduled on, based on node labels. By using node selectors, you can ensure that certain pods run only on nodes that meet specific criteria
     if my pod label is not matching it will not schedule on any node always trying to schedule on labeled node only otherwise it will not scheduled 
     

===============================================================================


2.Node affinity

requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: Ensures pods are scheduled only on nodes matching specific labels, but does not evict them if the labels change.

preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: Prefers nodes with specific labels but can schedule pods on any available nodes if necessary.

requiredDuringSchedulingRequiredDuringExecution: Not directly supported, but similar behavior can be achieved with taints and tolerations to ensure pods are scheduled and evicted based on node conditions.(taint toleration)


Node affinity is conceptually similar to nodeSelector, allowing you to constrain which nodes your Pod can be scheduled on based on node labels. There are two types of node affinity:

a.requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: The scheduler can't schedule the Pod unless the rule is met. This functions like nodeSelector, but with a more expressive syntax.
b.preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: The scheduler tries to find a node that meets the rule. If a matching node is not available, the scheduler still schedules the Pod any other node.

  

a.requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution
***it will schedule if matches the pod and node label only otherwise it will not schedule
 
Ex: a.Schedule a Pod using required node affinity
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: disktype
            operator: In
            values:
            - ssd            
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent


b.preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:

******if label match it will create in matched node or another node

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 1
        preference:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: disktype
            operator: In
            values:
            - ssd          
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent

======================================================================
3. Daemonset: 

A Daemonset is another controller that manages pods like Deployments, ReplicaSets, and StatefulSets. It was created for one particular purpose: ensuring that the pods it manages to run on all the cluster nodes.pod is going to schedule all available nodes 

ex : if we have three nodes same pod is going to schedule on three nodes 


apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: test-nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 200Mi
          requests:
            cpu: 50m
            memory: 100Mi
========================================================
#Taint and tolleration 

Taints
A taint is applied to a node to mark it as having some special property that only certain pods can tolerate. If a node has a taint, the scheduler will not place a pod on that node unless the pod has a matching toleration.
Two types:
Noschedule:
Noexecutive

# Below Commands are for Node Taint and Untaint proces :

ip-192-168-60-135.ap-south-1.compute.internal
kubectl label nodes ip-192-168-6-173.ap-south-1.compute.internal size=Large
kubectl taint nodes ip-192-168-6-173.ap-south-1.compute.internal app=blue:NoSchedule #taint 
kubectl taint nodes ip-192-168-60-135.ap-south-1.compute.internal app=blue:NoExecute #taint 




kubectl taint node ip-192-168-43-22.ap-south-1.compute.internal app=blue:NoSchedule- # untaint

kubectl taint nodes ip-192-168-60-135.ap-south-1.compute.internal app=green:NoExecute #taint 


kubectl taint node ip-192-168-43-22.ap-south-1.compute.internal app=blue:NoExecute #taint
kubectl taint node ip-192-168-43-22.ap-south-1.compute.internal app=blue:NoExecute-  # untaint

kubectl describe nodes ip-192-168-60-135.ap-south-1.compute.internall | grep Taints  #to list tainted nodes


toleration pod example:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    env: test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  tolerations:
  - key: "app"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "blue"
    effect: "NoSchedule"


IMP Note:

*Toleration pod only create into specfic tainted node if labels are match even tolerate pod con schedule on other node also but untolerate pod cant schedule on tainted node.

*The taint effect defines how a tainted node reacts to a pod without appropriate toleration. It must be one of the following effects; 

*NoSchedule—The pod will not get scheduled to the node without a matching toleration. (willnot schedule new pods on tainted node but runinng pods will not delete also after enable taint to nodes)

*NoExecute—This will immediately evict all the pods without the matching toleration from the node (no new pods will schedule will and also delete runinng pods also after enable taint to nodes)


------#############################  Node Drain process  ##############----

Draining a node in Kubernetes is a common operation for performing maintenance or decommissioning a node. The kubectl drain command safely evicts all the pods while ensuring minimal disruption to your applications.

Draining a Kubernetes node involves safely evicting all the pods from the node, so you can perform maintenance or remove the node from the cluster without disrupting services. Here is the step-by-step process to drain a node in Kubernetes:

Step-by-Step Guide to Drain a Kubernetes Node
Ensure you have access to your Kubernetes cluster:

Make sure your kubectl is configured to interact with your cluster.
Verify access by listing nodes:

kubectl get nodes
Drain the Node:

Use the kubectl drain command to safely evict all the pods from the node. This command ensures that your applications are gracefully terminated, and no new pods are scheduled on the node.

Replace ip-192-168-56-36.ap-south-1.compute.internal with your node's name.


kubectl drain ip-192-168-56-36.ap-south-1.compute.internal --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data
Explanation of the options:

--ignore-daemonsets: This option allows the node to be drained even if there are daemonset-managed pods on it.
--delete-emptydir-data: This option allows pods using emptyDir volumes to be deleted, as these volumes are tied to the node's filesystem and are ephemeral.
Example Command
Here is the command with the given node name:


kubectl drain ip-192-168-56-36.ap-south-1.compute.internal --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data
Verification
After running the drain command, verify that the node has been drained:



kubectl get nodes
The output should show that the node is in a SchedulingDisabled state, indicating that it has been drained and no new pods will be scheduled on it.

Uncordon the Node (Optional)
If you want to make the node schedulable again after performing maintenance, you can uncordon the node:



kubectl uncordon ip-192-168-56-36.ap-south-1.compute.internal


Draining a node in Kubernetes is a common operation for performing maintenance or decommissioning a node. The kubectl drain command safely evicts all the pods while ensuring minimal disruption to your applications. Remember to use --ignore-daemonsets and --delete-emptydir-data options to handle special cases. After maintenance, you can make the node schedulable again using the kubectl uncordon command.





===============================================volume============================
What is a Kubernetes volume?
A Kubernetes volume is a directory containing data accessible to containers in a given pod, 
the smallest deployable unit in a Kubernetes cluster. 
Within the Kubernetes container orchestration and management platform, 
volumes provide a plugin mechanism that connects ephemeral containers with persistent data storage.

A Kubernetes volume persists until its associated pod is deleted. 
When a pod with a unique identification is deleted, the volume associated with it is destroyed. 
If a pod is deleted but replaced with an identical pod, a new and identical volume is also created.

Step - 1
a) Create an EKS cluster with the clusteconfig file I provided.
b) Install helm in your local machine. Below is the link -> https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/
c) Connect to your EKS cluster. Check the connection.



Three types of create volume approaches 

  1. Static hots path (pv,pvc,deployment) not recomanded if node will delete volumes also delete
  2. Static cloud ebs(pv,pvc,deployment) static approach no effect even node will be deleted still volum persistent but ec2 volume need to create manually 
  3. Dynamic volume provision create by Storage class (pvc,storage class) here pv is going to create by Storage class

#Note: after create cluster we have to give Iam ec2 full access or admin access to node group IAM role then only ebs volume able to create by node 

Step - 2
Install CSI driver in EKS cluster by following below steps.
a) After connection execute the below commands.

helm repo add aws-ebs-csi-driver https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-ebs-csi-driver
helm repo update

#install aws ebs driver to kubernets 
helm upgrade --install aws-ebs-csi-driver --namespace kube-system aws-ebs-csi-driver/aws-ebs-csi-driver

#ReadWriteMany#
If you need to write to the volume, and you may have multiple Pods needing to write to the volume 
where you'd prefer the flexibility of those Pods being scheduled to different nodes, 
and ReadWriteMany is an option given the volume plugin for your K8s cluster, use ReadWriteMany.

#ReadWriteOnce#
If you need to write to the volume but either you don't have the requirement that multiple pods should be able to write to it, 
or ReadWriteMany simply isn't an available option for you, use ReadWriteOnce.

#ReadOnlyMany
If you only need to read from the volume, and you may have multiple Pods needing to read from the volume 
where you'd prefer the flexibility of those Pods being scheduled to different nodes, 
and ReadOnlyMany is an option given the volume plugin for your K8s cluster, use ReadOnlyMany.

If you only need to read from the volume but either you don't have the requirement that multiple pods should be able to read from it,
 or ReadOnlyMany simply isn't an available option for you, use ReadWriteOnce. 
In this case, you want the volume to be read-only but the limitations of your volume plugin have forced you to 
choose ReadWriteOnce (there's no ReadOnlyOnce option). As a good practice, consider the containers.volumeMounts.readOnly

#Statefulset

StatefulSet is the workload API object used to manage stateful applications.

Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods.

Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of its Pods. These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling.


Using StatefulSets :

StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following.

Stable, unique network identifiers.
Stable, persistent storage.
Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling.
Ordered, automated rolling updates.

  ################## Headless service ################################ 

A Headless Service is a variation of the ClusterIP Service, where the clusterIP field is set to None. Unlike traditional services, Headless Services do not use a single Service IP to proxy connections to the Pods. Instead, they allow you to directly connect to Pods without any load balancing intermediary.


Use Cases for Headless Services
Headless Services are particularly useful in the following scenarios:
Service Discovery: Some service discovery mechanisms, such as Kubernetes DNS-based service discovery, require direct access to individual Pods. Headless Services provide a convenient way to achieve this.
Stateful Applications: Applications that require direct access to individual Pods, such as databases or distributed storage systems, can benefit from using Headless Services.
Custom Load Balancing: If you need to implement custom load balancing logic or use a specific load balancing mechanism, Headless Services allow you to directly access the Pods without relying on Kubernetes' built-in load balancing.

Accessing Pods using Headless Services

example through DNS name:

Once you have created a Headless Service, you can access the Pods directly using their DNS names or IP addresses. 
The DNS name for each Pod follows the pattern <pod-ip>.<namespace>.pod.cluster.local.

##For example, if you have a Pod with the IP address 10.0.0.5 in the default namespace, you can access it using the DNS name like below 

10-0-0-5.default.pod.cluster.local.  -----dns name

Also

You can also access the Pods directly by their IP addresses, 
which can be useful for applications that require direct IP-based communication.
10-0-0-5 --ip of the target pod


Conclusion
Headless Services in Kubernetes offer a unique approach to accessing individual Pods directly, without relying on a load balancer or a single Service IP. This type of service is invaluable in scenarios where direct Pod access is required, such as service discovery mechanisms, stateful applications like databases, or when implementing custom load balancing logic.

By setting the clusterIP field to None, Headless Services bypass the traditional load balancing layer and instead provide a direct connection to individual Pods. This is achieved through the assignment of DNS records for each Pod, allowing you to access them by their DNS names or IP addresses.

         



 To access stateless to stateful communicate through headless service -->>> "podname.default.pod.cluster.local" here pod name is unique 




Ex: Apply below statefullset file if you observer we are creation two services in the same file one is nginx-normal service and nginx-headless service

        emptyDir: {}
      initContainers:
      - name: busybox
        image: busybox
        volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-volume
          mountPath: /nginx-data
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args: ["echo Hello from container $HOSTNAME > /nginx-data/index.html"]
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: k8s.gcr.io/nginx-slim:0.8
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: web
        volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-volume
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
        - name: www
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

now run below command to create stateless pod and afte login the pod and check ns lookup and curl to stateful nginx normal service and headless service
kubectl run -i --tty --image nginx:alpine dns-test 
# create pod and access service from pod by using curl # create pod and access service from pod by using nslookup.

==========================================================
nslookup<servcie name> nslookup <normal service name>

redirects to cluster IP works like internal load balancer

nslookup <normal Service name> 

we can see here cluster IP which means stateless Pod connect to stateful pod service cluster IP in this case also it will works like load balancer so not recommended   

nslookup <headless service name>

here result we can directly connect target pods without service so here we can define read pod and write pod 
Name:      mysql
Address 1: 192.168.11.161 mysql-0.mysql.default.svc.cluster.local
Address 2: 192.168.61.95 mysql-1.mysql.default.svc.cluster.local


# Curl to check response

curl nginx-normal service 

will get response from any one of the pod this is not recommended when i read should come response from read pod when write response will come for write pod


curl nginx-headless service 

so here also mostly request will go first pod always so to overcome this issue we can call like below 

curl podname.nginx-headless service 

ex: web0.nginx-headless service # always get response from web-0 only so stateless application communicate to stateful pod web-0 is for write operation 
web-1.nginx-headless service # always get response from web-1 only so stateless application communicate to stateful pod web-1 is for read operation 

so in this case for example only one db pod is there we can use directly deployment here there is no confusion for read and write so will go for deployment 

in this case we can use cluster ip service for internal communication stateless to stateful db pod.




================================ Probes =====================


Kubernetes, the industry-leading container orchestration tool, offers mechanisms to implement robust health checks for your applications. These checks, termed “probes,” act as guardians of your application's well-being, continuously monitoring the health status of your pods and their hosted applications

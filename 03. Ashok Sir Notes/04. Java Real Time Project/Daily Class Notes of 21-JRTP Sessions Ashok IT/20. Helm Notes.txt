=============
K8S HELM
============

-> We deployed our apps in Kubernetes cluster using Manifest files

-> Manifest files we can write in 2 ways

1) JSON
2) YML (more demand)

-> It is difficult to write manifest files for our applications

-> Helm is a package manager for k8s applications

-> Helm allows you to install or deploy applications on kubernetes cluster in a similar manner to yum/apt for linux distributions.

-> Helm lets you fetch, deploy and manage the lifecycle of applications both 3rd party apps and your own applications

Ex: prometheus, grafana, nginx-ingress, ELK stack are third party apps 


-> Helm introduces several familiar concepts such as 

Helm Chart (package contains k8s manifests - templates)

Helm Repositories which holds helm charts/packages

A CLI with install/upgrade/remove commands

Why to use Helm?
++++++++++++++++++

-> Deploying application on K8S cluster is little difficult 

-> As part of app deployment we need to create below k8s objects

Deployment
Service
ConfigMaps/Secrets
Volumes
Ingress Rules
HPA

-> Helm greatly simplifies the process of creating, deploying and managing applications on k8s cluster 

-> Heml also maintains a versioned history of very chart (application) installation. If something goes wrong , you can simply call 'helm rollback'.


-> Setting up a single application can involve creating multiple independent k8s resources and each resource requires a manifest file.


####################
What is Helm Chart
####################

-> HELM chart is a basically just a collection of manifest files organized in a specific directory structure that describe a related K8S resource.

-> There are two main components in HELM chart

1) template 
2) value

-> Templates and values renders a manifest which can understand by k8s 


-> Helm uses charts to pack all the required k8s components (manifests) for an application to deploy, run and scale.

-> charts are very similar to RPM and DEB packages for Linux.

Ex: yum install git

Note: it will interact with repo and it will download git 

 
##############
HELM Concepts
##############

-> Helm packages are called charts, and they consist of a few YML configuration files and some templates that are rendered into K8S manifest files. Here is the basic directory structure of a chart.

charts : dependent charts will be added here

templates: contains all template files

values : It contains values which are required for templates

Helm Installation
##################

$ curl -fsSl -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3

$ chmod 700 get_helm.sh

$ ./get_helm.sh

$ helm

-> check do we have metrics server on the cluster

$ kubectl top pods

$ kubectl top nodes

# check helm repos 
$ helm repo ls

# Before you can install the chart you will need to add the metrics-server repo to helm
$ helm repo add metrics-server https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/metrics-server/

# Install the chart
$ helm upgrade --install metrics-server metrics-server/metrics-server

$ helm list

$ helm delete <release-name>

=========
Git Hub
=========

=> It is version control software

-> Git Hub is a platform which is used to store project related files/code

-> In git hub, we can create source code repository to store project code.

-> All the developers can connect to project repository to store all the source code
   (Code Integration will become easy)

-> Git Hub repository will monitor all code changes

		 - who modified
		 - when modified
	     - what modified
		 - why modified

===================
Environment Setup
===================

1) Create account in www.github.com

2) Download & Install git client software

3) Open Git bash and configure your name and email

	$ git config --global user.name "your-name"

	$ git config --global user.email "your-email"

Note: Configuring name and email is just one time process.


===============================
What is Git Hub Repository ?
===============================

=> Repository is a place where we can store project source code / files.

=> For every project one repository will be created

=> We can create 2 types of repositories in git hub

	1) Public Repo (anybody can see & you choose who can commit)

	2) Private Repo (you choose who can see & commit)


## Project Git repo URL : https://github.com/ashokitschool/dcb_loans_app.git	

=> Project team members will connect with git repository using its URL.

==================
Git Architecture
==================

1) Working Tree

2) Stating Area

3) Local Repo

4) Central Repo

==============
Git commands
===============

git config : To configure name & email

git init : To initialize working tree

git status : To check working tree status

git add : To add files to staging area

git commit : To commit files from staging to local repo

git push : To send files from local repo to remote repo

git clone : To clone remote repo to local machine

git log : To see commit history

git restore : 1) To discard changes when the file is in unstaged state
			  
			  2) To unstage the file when it is added to staging area

git rm : To remove files  (rm + commit + push)

git revert : To remove our commits from central repository

			$ git revert <commit-id>

git pull : To take latest changes from central repo to local repo


==========================
What is .gitignore file ?
==========================

=> .gitignore is used to exclude files & folders from our commits

Ex: In maven project,  we should n't commit target folder to git repository hence we can give this info to git using .gitignore file.

=============
Git Branches
=============

=> In a project multiple teams will work paralelly

		1) Bug fixing
		2) Enhancements
		3) change request
		4) Research & Development

=> When multiple teams work on single repository then it will become very difficult to manage the code.		

=> Branches are used to maintain multiple code bases in the single repository.

=> In Realtime project, we will have below branches

		1) main (default)

		2) develop

		3) feature

		4) qa

		5) uat

		6) release/production

Note: We can create any no.of branches in single repository.

=> If we have branches in git repo then multiple teams can work paralelly without effecting other teams code.

===========================================
What is your project branching strategy ?
===========================================

=> It is the process of deciding which team should use which branch.

		final code => main branch

		dev activites => develop branch

		enhancements => feature branch

		bug fixing => qa branch

		r & d => research branch

		product deployment => release branch

=================================================

1) git stash
2) git merge
3) git rebase
4) git fetch
5) What is merge conflict ?
6) what is git tag?

================================================



==================
git stash command
==================

demo.java

//Story-121 (started : 9 am)

3:00 pm manager told to stop story-121 and work on story - 131

===============
git conflicts
===============

git pull : to bring latest code changes from central repo to local repo


=========================
git merge vs git rebase
=========================

merge : it will merge changes from one branch to another branch and it will preserve commit history.

rebase : it wil merge changes from one branch to another branch and it will not preserve commit history.

=======================
git pull vs git fetch
=======================

git pull: Download changes from central repo to local repo and merge changes in working tree.

git fetch : download changes from central repo to local repo.

Note: To merge changes from local repo to working tree we need to use 'git merge' command

		git pull = git fetch + git merge






git config
git init
git status
git add <filename>
git add .
git restore
git commit -m 'msg'
git push
git clone
git pull
git fetch
git merge
git merge <branch-name>
git rebase <branch-name>
git log
git rm
git branch
git checkout <branch-name>
git stash
git stash apply
git revert <commit-id>

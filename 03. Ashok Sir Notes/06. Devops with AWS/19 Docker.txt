===========================
Application Architecture
===========================

1) Frontend : User Interface (UI)

2) Backend : Business logic

3) Database : Storage

=============================
Tech Stack of Application
=============================

Frontend : Angular 16

Backend : Java 17

Database : MySQL Server 8.5

Webserver : Tomcat 9.0

Note: If we want to run our application code, then we need to setup all required dependencies in the machine.

Note: dependencies nothing but the softwares which are required to run our application

	Ex: java + Angular + MySQL + Tomcat server


==========================
Application Environments
==========================

=> In realtime we will use several environments to test our application.

1) DEV
2) SIT
3) UAT
4) PILOT
5) PROD (final delivery)

=> Dev env used by developers for code integration testing

=> SIT env used by Testers for system integration testing

=> UAT env used by client side team for acceptance testing (Go or No Go)

=> Pilot env used for pre-production testing

=> Prod env used for live deployment (end users can access our app)


=> As a devops enginner we are responsible to setup infrastructure to run our application

=> We need to install all required softwares (dependencies) to run our application

Note: We need to setup dependencies in all environments to run our application.

Note: There is a chance of doing mistakes in dependencies installation process (version compatability issues can occur)

=> To simplify application execution in any machine we can use Docker.

==================
What is Docker ?
==================

=> Docker is a free & open source software

=> Docker is used for containerization

=> With the help of docker, we can run our application in any machine.

	Container = package (app code + app dependencies)

=> Docker will take care of dependencies installation required for app execution.

=> We can make our application portable using Docker.

=====================
Docker Architecture
=====================

1) Dockerfile
2) Docker Image
3) Docker Registry
4) Docker Container

=> Dockerfile is used to specify where is app code and what dependencies are required for our application execution.

Note: Dockerfile is required to build docker image.

=> Docker Image is a package which contains code + dependencies

=> Docker Registry is used to store Docker Images.

Note: When we run docker image then Docker container will be created. Docker container is a linux virtual machine.

=> Docker Container is used to run our application.


=============================
Install Docker in Linux VM
=============================

Step-1 : Create EC2 VM (amazon linux) & connect with that vm using ssh client

Step-2 : Execute below commands

# Install Docker
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install docker -y
sudo service docker start

# Add ec2-user user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user

# Exit from terminal and Connect again
exit

# Verify Docker installation
docker -v


==================
Docker commands
==================

docker images : To display docker images available in our system

docker ps : To display running docker containers

docker logs <container-id> : To display container logs

docker ps -a : To display running + stopped containers

docker pull <image-id/name> : To download docker image from docker hub

docker rmi <image-id/name> : To delete docker image

docker run <image-id/name> : To create/run docker container

docker stop <container-id> : To stop running docker container

docker start <container-id> : To start docker container which is in stopped state

docker rm <container-id> : To delete docker container

# delete stopped containers + unused images + build cache
docker system prune -a


=======================================================
Running Real-world applications using docker images
=======================================================

docker pull ashokit/spring-boot-rest-api
docker run -d ashokit/spring-boot-rest-api
docker run -d -p 9090:9090 ashokit/spring-boot-rest-api

URL : http://public-ip:host-port/welcome/{name}

docker pull ashokit/python-flask-app
docker run -d ashokit/python-flask-app
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 ashokit/python-flask-app

Note: Here -d represents detached mode.
Note: Here -p represents port mapping. (host-port:container-port)

Note: host port and container port no need to be same.
Note: In one machine we can use 65k port numbers.

Note: To access application running in the container we will use below URL

	URL : http://host-vm-public-ip:host-port/

Note: Host port number we need to enable in ec2-vm security group inbound rules to allow the traffic.


=============
Dockerfile
=============

=> Dockerfile contains set of instructions to build docker image

		Filename : Dockerfile

=> To write dockerfile we will use below keywords

	1) FROM
	2) MAINTAINER
	3) RUN
	4) CMD
	5) COPY
	6) ADD
	7) WORKDIR
	8) EXPOSE
	9) ENTRYPOINT
	10) USER

====
FROM
=====

=> It is used to specify base image for our application

Ex: 

FROM openjdk:17
FROM python:3.3
FROM node:19.5
FROM mysql:8.5
FROM tomcat:9.0

============
MAINTAINER
============

=> MAINTAINER is used to specify who is author of this Dockerfile

Ex :

MAINTAINER Ashok<ashok.b@oracle.com>

=====
RUN 
=====

=> RUN keyword is used to specify instructions to execute at the time of docker image creation.

Ex:

RUN 'git clone <url>'
RUN 'mvn clean package'

Note: We can write multiple RUN instructions in single docker file and all those instructions will be processed in the order.

=====
CMD
=====

=> CMD keyword is used to specify instructions to execute at the time of docker container creation.

Ex:

CMD 'java -jar app.jar'

CMD 'app.py'

Note: We can write multiple CMD instructions in single docker file but docker will process only last CMD instruction.

===========
ENTRYPOINT
===========

=> Entrypoint is used to execute instructions when docker container is creating.

Ex: 

ENTRYPOINT["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]

ENTRYPOINT["python", "app.py"]

Note: CMD instruction we can override using command line arguments where ENTRYPOINT instruction we can't override.

========
COPY
=========

=> It is used to copy files from host machine to container machine

Ex:

COPY target/app.jar  /usr/app/app.jar

COPY target/app.war  /usr/app/tomcat/webapps/app.war

COPY app.py /usr/app/app.py

=============
ADD Keyword
=============

=> It is also used to copy files from source to destination.

Ex:

ADD target/app.jar  /usr/app/app.jar

ADD <http-url>  /usr/app/app.jar

==========
WORKDIR
==========

=> It is used to set working directory (directory navigation)

COPY target/app.jar  /usr/app/app.jar

WORKDIR /usr/app

CMD 'java -jar app.jar'

======
USER
======

=> It is used to set USER to run commands

========
EXPOSE
========

=> It is used to specify on which port number our application will run in container

Ex:

EXPOSE 8080

Note: It is only to provide inforation. We can't change container port using EXPOSE.


==================
Sample Dockerfile
==================

FROM ubuntu

MAINTAINER Ashok <ashok.b@oracle.com>

RUN echo 'hello from run instruction-1'
RUN echo 'hello from run instruction-2'

CMD echo 'hi from cmd-1'
CMD echo 'hi from cmd-2'

-----------------------

# create docker image using dockerfile
$ docker build -t img-1 .

# Run docker image to create docker container
$ docker run img-1

==================================================
how to push docker image into docker hub account
==================================================

# login into docker hub account
$ docker login

# tag docker image
$ docker tag <image-name> <tag-name>

Ex : docker tag img-1 ashokit/img-1

$ push docker image to docker hub
$ docker push <tag-name>


===========================
Dockerizing java web app
===========================

=> Java web app will be packaged as war file

Note: war file will be created inside target directory

=> To deploy war file we need web server (Ex: tomcat)

=> Inside tomcat server webapps directory we need to place our war file to run the application.

######### Dockerfile to run java web app ############

FROM tomcat:latest

MAINTAINER Ashok

EXPOSE 8080

COPY target/app.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/

========================================================

@@ Java Web App Git Repo : https://github.com/ashokitschool/maven-web-app.git

$ cd maven-web-app

$ mvn clean package

$ ls -l target

$ docker build -t <img-name> .

$ docker images

$ docker run -d -p <host-port:container-port> <img-name>

=> Enable host port number in security group inbound rules and access our application

		URL : http://public-ip:host-port/war-file-name/

===================================================================

=========================================
Dockerizing Java Spring Boot Application
=========================================

=> Every SpringBoot application will be packaged as jar file only

=> To run spring boot application we need to execute jar file.

	Syntax : java -jar <jar-file-name>

Note: When we run springboot application jar file then springboot will start tomcat server with 8080 port number (embedded tomcat server).

=============== Dockerfile for Spring Boot Application =============

FROM openjdk:17

MAINTAINER Ashok

COPY target/app.jar /usr/app/

WORKDIR /usr/app/

$ docker run -d -p 8080:8080 sb-app

Note: Once container created check logs of container

$ docker logs <container-id>

Note: Access our application using host-vm public and host port

		URL : http://localhost:host-port/


=====================================
Dockerize Python Flask Application
=====================================

=> Python is a scripting language

=> We don't need any build tool for python app

=> Directley we can run python programs

	Ex : python app.py

=> Flask is a python library which is to develop rest apis in python.	

=> To download flask library we will use 'python pip software'

Note: We will configure dependencies in "requirements.txt"

=============== Dockerfile for Python Flask App =================

FROM python:3.6

MAINTAINER Ashok

COPY . /usr/app/

WORKDIR /usr/app/

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

EXPOSE 5000

ENTRYPOINT ["python", "app.py"]

===================================================================

$ git clone https://github.com/ashokitschool/python-flask-docker-app.git

$ cd python-flask-docker-app

$ docker build -t <img-name> .

$ docker run -d -p 5000:5000 <img-name>

$ docker ps

Note: Enable 5000 port in security group inbound rules.

=> Access application with URL

			URL : http://public-ip:host-port/

============================================
Can we get into docker container machine ?	
============================================

Yes, using below commands

# display running docker containers info
$ docker ps

# get into container using container id
$ docker exec -it <container-id> /bin/bash

# check files in pwd
$ ls -l

# come out from container vm to host vm
$ exit




===================================================
Task-1: Run jenkins server using docker

Task-2: setup mysql db using docker

Task-3: Write docker file to execute reactjs app
====================================================

================
Docker Network
================

=> Network is all about communication

=> Docker network is used to provide isolated network for containers

=> If we run 2 containers under same network then one contianer can communicate with another container.

=> By default we have 3 networks in Docker

	1) bridge
	2) host
	3) none

=> Bridge network is used to run standalone containers. It will assign one IP for container. It is the default network for docker container.

=> Host network is also used to run standalone containers. This will not assign any ip for our container.	

=> None means no network will be available.

=> We can use 2 other networks also in docker

				1) Overlay
				2) MacvLan

=> Overlay network is used for Orchestration purpose (Docker Swarm)	

=> Macvlan network will assign physical Ip for our container.	

# display docker networks
$ docker network ls

# create docker network
$ docker network create ashokit-nw

# inspect docker network
$ docker network inspect ashokit-nw

# create docker container with custom network
$ docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --network ashokit-nw sb-app-image

# delete docker network
$ docker network rm ashokit-nw

===============
Docker Compose
===============

=> Earlier ppl developed projects using Monolithic Architecture (everthing in single app)

=> Now a days projects are developing based on Microservices architecture.

=> Microservices means multiple backend apis will be avialable

	Ex: 
			hotels-api
			flights-api
			trains-api
			cabs-api...

=> For every API we need to create seperate container.

Note: When we have multiple containers like this management will become very 
difficult (create / stop / start)

=> To overcome these problems we will use Docker Compose.

=> Docker Compose is used to manage Multi - Container Based applications.

=> In docker compose, using single command we can create / stop / start multiple containers at a time.

===================================
What is docker-compose.yml file ?
===================================

=> docker-compose.yml file is used to specify containers information.

=> The default file name is docker-compose.yml (we can change it).

=> docker-compose.yml file contains below 4 sections

version : It represents compose yml version

services: It represents containers information (image-name, port-mapping etc..)

networks: Represents docker network to run our containers

volumes: Represents containers storage location


======================
Docker Compose Setup
======================

# install docker compose
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.24.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# Check docker compose is installed or not
$ docker-compose --version

================================================
Spring Boot with MySQL DB using Docker-Compose
================================================

version: "3"
services:
  application:
    image: spring-boot-mysql-app
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    networks:
      - springboot-db-net
    depends_on:
      - mysqldb
    volumes:
      - /data/springboot-app

  mysqldb:
    image: mysql:5.7
    networks:
      - springboot-db-net
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=sbms
    volumes:
      - /data/mysql
networks:
  springboot-db-net:

================================
 Application Execution Process
================================

# clone git repo
$ git clone https://github.com/ashokitschool/spring-boot-mysql-docker-compose.git

# go inside project directory
$ cd spring-boot-mysql-docker-compose

# build project using maven
$ mvn clean package

# build docker image
$ docker build -t spring-boot-mysql-app .

# check docker images
$ docker images

# create docker containers using docker-compose
$ docker-compose up -d

# check docker containers running
$ docker-compose ps

# stop docker containers running
$ docker-compose stop

# start docker containers running
$ docker-compose start

# delete docker containers using docker-compose
$ docker-compose down


====================================
Stateful Vs Stateless Containers
====================================

Stateless Container : Data will be deleted after container deletion.

Statefull Container : Data will be available permanently

Note: Docker containers are stateless by default.

Note: In spring-boot-mysql app, we are using mysqldb as docker container to store application data. When we re-create containers db also got recreated hence we lost data (this is not accepted in realtime).

=> To maintain data permanently, we need to make docker container as statefull.

=> To make container as statefull, we need to use Docker volumes concept.

================
Docker Volumes
================

=> Volumes are used to persist data which is generated by docker container.

=> Volumes are used to avoid data loss

=> Using volumes we can make container as statefull

=> We have 3 types of volumes in docker

		1) Anonymous volume (no name)
		2) Named Volume
		3) Bind mounts

# display docker volumes
$ docker volume ls

# docker volume create
$ docker volume create <vol-name>

# inspect docker volume
$ docker volume inspect <vol-name>

# Remove docker volume
$ docker volume rm <vol-name>

# Remove all docker volumes
$ docker system prune --volumes


=================================
Making docker container stateful
=================================

=> Create mount directory on host machine (path : /home/ec2-user/)

	$ mkdir app

=> Map this 'app' directory in docker-compose.yml like below

======================docker-compose.yml===============
version: "3"
services:
  application:
    image: spring-boot-mysql-app
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    networks:
      - springboot-db-net
    depends_on:
      - mysqldb
    volumes:
      - /data/springboot-app
  mysqldb:
    image: mysql:5.7
    networks:
      - springboot-db-net
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=sbms
    volumes:
      - .app:/var/lib/mysql
networks:
  springboot-db-net:  
=========================================================

=============
Docker Swarm
=============

=> It is an Orchestration platform

=> Orchestration means Managing the process (containers)

=> Docker swarm is used to setup docker cluster

=> Cluster means group of servers

============================
Docker Swarm Cluster Setup
============================

-> Create 3 EC2 instances (ubuntu) & install docker in all 3 instances using below 2 commands

$ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
$ sudo sh get-docker.sh

Note: Enable 2377 port in security group for Swarm Cluster Communications


1  - Master Node
2  - Worker Nodes


-> Connect to Master Machine and execute below command

# Initialize docker swarm cluster
$ sudo docker swarm init --advertise-addr <private-ip-of-master-node>

Ex : $ sudo docker swarm init --advertise-addr 172.31.41.217

# Get Join token from master  (this token is used by workers to join with master)
$ sudo docker swarm join-token worker

Note: Copy the token and execute in all worker nodes with sudo permission

Ex: sudo docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-4pkn4fiwm09haue0v633s6snitq693p1h7d1774c8y0hfl9yz9-8l7vptikm0x29shtkhn0ki8wz 172.31.37.100:2377

-> In Docker swarm we need to deploy our application as a service.

====================
Docker Swarm Service
====================

-> Service is collection of one or more containers of same image

-> There are 2 types of services in docker swarm

1) Replica (default mode)
2) global


$ sudo docker service create --name <serviceName> -p <hostPort>:<containerPort> <imageName>

Ex :  $ sudo docker service create --name java-web-app -p 8080:8080 ashokit/javawebapp

Note: By default 1 replica will be created


Note: We can access our application using below URL pattern

	URL : http://master-node-public-ip:8080/java-web-app/


# check the services created
$ sudo docker service ls 

# we can scale docker service
$ docker service scale <serviceName>=<no.of.replicas>

# inspect docker service
$ sudo docker service inspect --pretty <service-name>

# see service details
$ sudo docker service ps <service-name>

# Remove one node from swarm cluster
$ sudo docker swarm leave

# remove docker service 
$ sudo docker service rm <service-name>

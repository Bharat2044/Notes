What is Cache 
=================

=> Every application will contain two types of tables

		1) Transactional tables

		2) Non-Transactional tables


=> If our application is performing DML operations on the table then those tables are called as Tx tables.

		Ex: user_table, product_table, book_table....

=> If our application is performing only DQL (Select) operations on the table then those tables are called as Non-Tx tables. These are also called as static tables.

		Ex : country_table, state_table.


=> It is not recommended to read static data from DB table everytime. Because DB call is costly operation which will reduce performance of the application.

	(driver loading + connection + query execution + data process + conn close)

Note: To improve performance of the application we need to maintain cache.	

==============
Redis Server
===============

=> Redis means Remote Dictionary Server.

=> It is an open source in-memory data store.

=> It is used as database, cache, message broker...

=> The main purpose of REDIS Cache is used to improve performance of our application by simplifying read and write operations.

=> Redis is known for its speed, flexibility, and ease of use.

=> It is one stop solution when we want to perform quick read and write operations.

===============
RDBMS Vs Redis
===============

=> We will use RDBMS for below scenarios

1) Structured data
2) Tables, rows, columns
3) Complex queries
4) Joins
5) Complex Transactions
6) Relationships are critical

=> We will use Redis for below scenarios

1) Fast Read and Write operations
2) Key-Value format
3) Data Structures like Strings, hashes, lists, sets
4) Relationships are not critical
5) Transactions are not crictical
6) Performance is more important
7) Real-Data Analysis


===================
Redis Server Setup
===================

=> Setup Redis DB Using Redis cloud

	Login URL : https://cloud.redis.io/#/login

	Note: Sign in with google

=> Under free subscription, create redis db

	Redis Endpoint URL : redis-13442.c125.ap-south-1-1.ec2.redns.redis-cloud.com

	Redis Port : 13442

	username : default

	Password : ashokitit


Note: Our Redis Server is ready in cloud, now we can develop SpringBoot application to connect with Redis Server.

@@ Spring Boot + Redis DB Git Repo :: https://github.com/ashokitschool/SpringBoot_Redis_Cloud_DB_App.git
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step-1 : Create springboot app with below dependencies
		
			a) web-starter
			b) starter-data-redis
			c) jedis
			d) devtools

<dependency>
	<groupId>redis.clients</groupId>
	<artifactId>jedis</artifactId>
</dependency>			

## Step-2 :: Configure redis db server details in application.properties file			

		spring.data.redis.url=redis-10332.c305.ap-south-1-1.ec2.cloud.redislabs.com
		spring.data.redis.port=10332
		spring.data.redis.username=default
		spring.data.redis.password=r4qJQ24x1PsNXQqJSknlyl


## Step-3 :: Create RedisConfig class to establish connect with Redis Server

## Step-4 :: Create Entity to represent data (@RedisHash)

## Step-5 :: Create Repository to perform CRUD operations

## Step-6 :: Create REST Controller with HTTP methods

## Step-7 :: Test the application from postman.

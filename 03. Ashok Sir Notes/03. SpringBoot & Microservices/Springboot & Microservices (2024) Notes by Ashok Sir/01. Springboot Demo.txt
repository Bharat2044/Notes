========================================
Core Java vs Adv Java vs Java Framework
========================================

==========
Core Java
==========

=> Core java means J2SE
=> Core Java is base to become java developer
=> In core java java fundamentals will be available

			- data types
			- arrays
			- strings
			- oops
			- collections
			- exception handling
			- io streams
			- lambdas
			- stream api
			- threads

-> using core java we can develop standalone apps 
  (one user can access a time)

	Ex : notepad, calc, eclipse, intellij idea....

================
Adv Java (JEE)	
================

=> JEE developed based on JSE only
=> JEE is called as Java Technology

			- Servlets
			- JSP

=> Using this JEE we can develop web applications 
   (multiple users can access at a time thru internet)

	Ex: gmail, facebook, naukri, youtube

=> To run web application  server is required
	
	Ex: Tomcat, glassfish, jboss, jetty, netty	

	1) Web Servers (Ex : Tomcat)

	2) App Servers	(ex: JBOSS, Web Logic, Web Sphere)


Note: App Server provides more functionalities than web server
	
		Ex : EJB container, security, conn pooling....	


=> Application can be developed in 2 ways

		1) Monolithic (outdated)
		2) Microservices (trending)

============
Monolithic	
============

=> Developing all the functionalities in single app

=> We have below challenges in monolithic

		1) Maintenance Difficult

		2) Single point of failure

		3) Re-Deploy entire app

		4) Technology dependent

=> To overcome problems of monolith, we are using microservices architecture.

=================
Microservices	
================

=> It is an approach to develop application functionalities with loosely coupling.

=> Application functionalities will be developed in multiple services/apis.

=> Every microservice will run in seperate server 

=> Every microservice is independently deployable and executable.

=> We have below advantages with microservices

	1) Functionality distributed

	2) Loosely coupled

	3) No single point of failure

	4) Technology independent


=================
Java Frameworks	
=================	

=> Framework is a semi developed software

=> Frameworks providing common logics for application development

=> If we use frameworks then we need to focus only on business logic

=> Using frameworks we can do more work in less time (productivity)

=> We have several frameworks in java community

			1) JSF -----------> outdated
			2) Hibernate -----> data jpa
			3) Struts -------> out dated
			4) Spring ---> SpringBoot ----> trending

Note: The above frameworks developed by using JSE and JEE.			


=> Hibernate is an ORM framework.
=> ORM means Object Relational Mapping
=> Using Hibernate we can develop persistence layer
=> Hibernate developed on top of JDBC.


=> Struts framework developed by Apache
=> Struus is used to develop only web layer

=> Spring is called as application development framework
=> Using spring we can develop entire application.
=> Spring is free of cost & open source
=> Spring framework provides common logics required for application development.

Note: SpringBoot is an extension for Spring Framework.

================================
What is Monolith Architecture
================================
-> If we develop all the functionalities in single project then it is called as Monolith architecture based application

-> We will package our application as a jar/war to deploy into server

-> As monolith application contains all functionalities, it will become fat jar/war

-------------
Advantages
-------------
1) Simple to develop

2) Everything is available at once place

3) Configuration required only once

---------------
Dis-Advantages
----------------

1) Difficult to maintain

2) Dependencies among the functionalites

3) Single Point Of Failure

4) Entire Project Re-Deployment


****** To overcome the problems of Monolithic, Microservices architecture came into market******

-> Microservices is not a programming language

-> Microservices is not a framework

-> Microservices is not an API

######	Microservices is an architectural design pattern #####

-> Microservices suggesting to develop application functionalities with loosely coupling

-> In Microservices architecture we don't develop all the functionalities in single project. We will divide project functionalities into several REST APIs.

*********************Note: One REST API is called as one Microservice************************

-> Microservices architecture based project means collection of REST APIs.

-> Microservices is not related to only java. Any programming language specific project can use Microservices Architecture.


-------------
Advantages
-------------

1) Loosely Coupling

2) Easy To maintain

3) Faster Development

4) Quick Deployment

5) Faster Releases

6) Less Downtime

7) Technology Independence (We can develop backend apis with multiple technologies)


---------------
Dis-Advantages
----------------

1) Bounded Context (Deciding no.of services to be created)

2) Lot of configurations

3) Visibility

4) Pack of cards



===========================
Microservices Architecture
===========================

-> We don't have any fixed architecture for Microservices

-> People are customizing microservices architecture according to their Project requirement

-> Most of the projects will use below components in Microservices Architecture


1) Service Registry (Eureka Server)

2) Services (REST APIs)

3) Interservice Communication (FeginClient)

4) API Gateway

5) Admin Server

6) Zipkin


===================
Service Registry
===================
-> Service Registry acts as DB of services available in the project
-> It provides the details of all the services which are registered with Service Registry
-> We can identify how many services available in the project
-> We can identify how many instances available for each service
-> We can use "Eureka Server" as service registry
-> Eureka Server provided by "Spring Cloud Netflix" library



===================
Backend Services
===================
-> Services means REST APIs / Microservices
-> Services contains backend business logic
-> In the project, some services will interact with DB
-> In the project, some services will interact with third party REST API ( external communication )
-> In the project, some services will interact with another services with in the project
   ( inter-service communication )
-> For inter-service communication we will use feign-client
-> To distribute the load, we can run one service with Multiple Instances (Load Balancing)

Note: We will register every service with Service Registry



============
API Gateway
=============
-> API Gateway is used to manage our backend apis of the project
-> API Gateway acts as mediator between end users and backend apis
-> API Gateway can contain filter logic to decide request processing (Authentication)
-> API Gateway will contain Routing logic (which request should go to which REST API)
-> API Gateway also will be registered with Service Registry
-> Spring Cloud Gateway we can use as API Gateway


==============
Admin Server
==============

-> Admin Server is used to manage all backend apis actuator endpoints at one place
-> Our backend apis will be registered with Admin Server
-> Admin Server will provide User interface to monitor apis actuator endpoints


=============
Zipin Server
=============

-> Zipkin Server is used for Distributed Tracing
-> Using this Zipkin, we can monitor which API is taking more time to process our request.


=============================================================
Mini Project Implementation using Microservices Architecture
=============================================================

STOCK-PRICE-API : It will maintain companies stock price details in db table

-> Input : Company Name
-> Output : Company Stock Price Value

Sample Data
------------
TCS-3000
HCL-1500
AXIS-1200


STOCK-PRICE-CALC-API : It is used to calculate total stocks cost based on company name and quantity

-> Input : Company Name & Quantity
-> Output : Total Stocks Cost

Note: To calculate total stocks cost, STOCK-PRICE-CALC-API should get company stock price from STOCK-PRICE-API (INTER SERVICE COMMUNICATION)

===============================================================
Steps to develop Service Registry Application (Eureka Server)
===============================================================
1) Create Service Registry application with below dependency

	 - EurekaServer (spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server)

2) Configure @EnableEurekaServer annotation in boot start class

3) Configure below properties in application.yml file

server:
  port: 8761
  
eureka:
  client:
    register-with-eureka: false

Note: If Service-Registry project port is 8761 then clients can discover service-registry and will register automatically with service-registry. If service-registry project running on any other port number then we have to register clients with service-registry manually.

4) Once application started we can access Eureka Dashboard using below URL

		URL : http://localhost:8761/



Steps to develop stock-price-api (Eureka-Client-1)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1) Create Spring Boot application with below dependencies

		- eureka-discovery-client
		- starter-web
		- starter-datajpa
		- h2
		- devtools

2) Configure @EnableDiscoveryClient annotation at start class

3) Configure below properties in application.yml file

			server-port
			h2-datasource-properties
			application-name

-----------------------------------application.yml-----------------------------------------
server:
  port: 1111
spring:
  application:
    name: STOCK-PRICE-API
  datasource:
    username: sa
    password: sa
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
    driver-class-name: org.h2.Driver
  jpa:
    defer-datasource-initialization: true

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Create Entity class & Repository interface for COMPANY STOCK PRICE DETAILS

5) Create "data.sql" file under src/main/resource folder with insert queries to load data into db table like below

INSERT INTO STOCK_PRICE_DTLS (STOCK_ID, COMPANY_NAME, COMPANY_PRICE) VALUES (101, 'TCS', 3000.00);
INSERT INTO STOCK_PRICE_DTLS (STOCK_ID, COMPANY_NAME, COMPANY_PRICE) VALUES (102, 'HCL', 1500.00);
INSERT INTO STOCK_PRICE_DTLS (STOCK_ID, COMPANY_NAME, COMPANY_PRICE) VALUES (103, 'HDFC', 4500.00);
INSERT INTO STOCK_PRICE_DTLS (STOCK_ID, COMPANY_NAME, COMPANY_PRICE) VALUES (104, 'SBI', 450.00);

6) Create RestController to handle request & response

		Input : CompanyName (Path Parameter)
		Output : Stock Price Details

7) Run the application and check in Eureka Dashboard (It should display in eureka dashboard)



Steps To Develop STOCK-PRICE-CALC-API (EUREKA-CLIENT-2)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1) Create Spring Boot application with below dependencies

			- web-starter
			- devtools
			- eureka-discovery-client
			- fegin-client

2) Configure @EnableDiscoveryClient annotation at boot start class

3) Configure Server Port & application name in application.yml file

4) Create Rest Controller with required method

		Input : Company Name & Quantity (Path Paramters)

		Output : Total Cost

Note: In Rest Controller we should have logic to access STOCK-PRICE-API

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@RestController
public class StockCalcRestController {

	@GetMapping("/calc/{cname}/{qty}")
	public ResponseEntity<String> calculate(@PathVariable String cname, @PathVariable Integer qty) {

		String url = "http://localhost:1111/price/{cname}";
		RestTemplate rt = new RestTemplate();
		ResponseEntity<StockPrice> resEntity = rt.getForEntity(url, StockPrice.class, cname);
		StockPrice body = resEntity.getBody();
		Double companyPrice = body.getCompanyPrice();

		Double totalCost = companyPrice * qty;

		String msg = "Total Cost : " + totalCost;

		return new ResponseEntity<>(msg, HttpStatus.OK);
	}
}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> In the above logic we have hard coded STOCK-PRICE-API url

-> If STOCK-PRICE-API url changed then calc-api logic should be changed

-> If STOCK-PRICE-API is running in Multiple instances for load balancing our calc-api should access all the instances in round-robbin methodology

-> To overcome these problems we can use Interservice Communication using FeignClient

-> Using FeginClient we can make rest call to another service using name of the service (no need of url)

-> FeginClient will get service URL from service-registry based on service-name

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@FeignClient(name = "STOCK-PRICE-API")
public interface StockPriceClient {
	
	@GetMapping("/price/{cname}")
	public StockPrice invokeStockPrice(@PathVariable String cname);

}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note : Write @EnableFeignClients annotation at boot start class
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@RestController
public class StockCalcRestController {
	
	
	@Autowired
	private StockPriceClient priceClient;

	@GetMapping("/calc/{cname}/{qty}")
	public ResponseEntity<String> calculate(@PathVariable String cname, @PathVariable Integer qty) {

		StockPrice stockPrice = priceClient.invokeStockPrice(cname);
		Double companyPrice = stockPrice.getCompanyPrice();

		Double totalCost = companyPrice * qty;

		String msg = "Total Cost : " + totalCost;

		return new ResponseEntity<>(msg, HttpStatus.OK);
	}
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Note: Run price-api with multiple instances using Run Configuration Option

Note: Configure Port Number as VM Argument in Run Configuration
	
		-Dserver.port=port-number

#############
API Gateway
##############

-> API Gateway will act as mediator between client requests & backend apis

-> API Gateway will provide single entrypoint to access our backend apis

-> In Api Gateway we will write mainley below 2 types of logics

			1) Filters

			2) Routing

-> Filters are used to execute some logic before request processing and after request processing

-> Routing is used to tell which request should go to which REST API

-> In Spring Cloud we have 2 options to create API Gateway

				1) Zuul Proxy (old approach)
				2) Cloud Gateway (latest approach)


Note: Zuul Proxy is not supported by latest versions of spring boot


#####################################
Working with Spring Cloud API Gateway
#####################################

1) Create Spring boot application with below dependencies

		-> web-stater
		-> eureka-client
		-> cloud-gateway
		-> devtools

2) Configure @EnableDiscoveryClient annotation at boot start class

3) Configure API Gateway Routings in application.yml file like below

----------------------------------------application.yml file-----------------------------------------------
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      discovery.locator:
        enabled: true
        lowerCaseServiceId: true
      routes:
      - id: stock-price-api
        uri: lb://STOCK-PRICE-API
        predicates:
        - Path=/price/{companyName}
      - id: stock-calc-api
        uri: lb://STOCK-CALC-API
        predicates:
        - Path=/calc/{companyName}/{qty}
  application:
    name: CLOUD-API-GATEWAY
server:
  port: 3333
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In API gateway we will have 3 types of logics

1) Route

2) Predicate

3) Filters

-> Routing is used to defined which request should be processed by which REST API in backend. Routes will be configured using Predicate

-> Predicate : This is a Java 8 Function Predicate. The input type is a Spring Framework ServerWebExchange. This lets you match on anything from the HTTP request, such as headers or parameters.

-> Filters are used to manipulate incoming request and outgoing response of our application

Note: Using Filters we can implement security also for our application.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Component
public class MyPreFilter implements GlobalFilter {

	private Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyPreFilter.class);

	@Override
	public Mono<Void> filter(ServerWebExchange exchange, GatewayFilterChain chain) {

		logger.info("MyPreFilter :: filter () method executed...");

		// Accessing HTTP Request information
		ServerHttpRequest request = exchange.getRequest();

		HttpHeaders headers = request.getHeaders();
		Set<String> keySet = headers.keySet();
		
		keySet.forEach(key -> {
			List<String> values = headers.get(key);
			System.out.println(key +" :: "+values);
		});

		return chain.filter(exchange);
	}
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Component
public class MyPostFilter implements GlobalFilter {

	final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyPostFilter.class);

	@Override
	public Mono<Void> filter(ServerWebExchange exchange, GatewayFilterChain chain) {

		return chain.filter(exchange).then(Mono.fromRunnable(() -> {
			logger.info("Global Post-filter executed...");
		}));
	}

}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> We can validate client given token in the request using Filter for security purpose

-> We can write request and response tracking logic in Filter

-> Filters are used to manipulate request & response of our application

-> Any cross-cutting logics like security, logging, moniroing can be implemented using Filters



===========================================
Spring Boot Admin Server and Admin Client
============================================

-> Admin server will provide user interface to monitor and manage all the apis actuator endpoints

-> The REST APIs of our application should register with admin server (It is called as Admin client)


Note: Using this approach we can monitor all the apis at one place


---------------------------
Working with Admin-Server
---------------------------
1) Create Boot application with admin-server dependency (select it while creating the project)

2) Configure @EnableAdminServer annotation at start class

3) Run the boot application

4) Access application URL in browser (We can see Admin Server UI)


---------------------------
Working with Admin-Client
---------------------------
1) Create Spring Boot application with below dependecies

		a) starter-web
		b) starter-actuator
		c) admin-starter-client
		d) devtools

2) Configure below properties in application.yml file

		a) server-port
		b) application-name
		c) enable-actuator-endpoints
		d) configure admin serve URL to reiger

----------------------------------application.yml-------------------------------------
server:
  port: 1111
spring:
  application:
    name: CLIENT-ONE
  boot:
    admin:
      client:
        url: http://localhost:8080/
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: '*'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Create Rest Controller with required methods

4) Run the appplication (It will register in Admin Server)


######################
Cloud Config Server
######################

-> It is used to seperate our application and application config properties

	Ex: SMTP props, DB props, App msgs etc...

-> We can externalize configuration properties by using Config Server

-> We will maintain application configuration yml files in git hub repo.

-> Config Server application will connect with Git Hub repo to load all ymls

-> Our APIs (Microservices) will connect with config server to load yml data based on application name.

Note: app name and yml file name should be same.

Note: If we use config server then we no need to re-package our application when we make some changes in properties.


==================
Config Server App
===================

1) Create Git Repository and keep ymls files required for projects 

			Note: We should keep file name as application name

			app name : greet  then file name : greet.yml

			app name : welcome then file name : welcome.yml


		### Git Repo : https://github.com/ashokitschool/configuration_properties


2) Create Spring Starter application with below dependency

	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-cloud-config-server</artifactId>
	</dependency>

3) Write @EnableConfigServer annotation at boot start class


@SpringBootApplication
@EnableConfigServer
public class Application {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
	}

}

4) Configure below properties in application.yml file

spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/ashokitschool/configuration_properties
          clone-on-start: true

5) Run Config Server application

=================================
Config Server Client Development
=================================

1) Create Spring Boot application with below dependencies

				a) web-starter
				b) config-client
				c) dev-tools

<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-config</artifactId>
</dependency>


2) Create Rest Controller with Required methods

@RestController
public class WelcomeRestController {

	@Value("${msg}")
	private String msg;

	@GetMapping("/")
	public String getWelcomeMsg() {
		return msg;
	}
}

3) Configure ConfigServer url in application.yml file like below

server:
  port: 8081
spring:
  config:
    import: optional:configserver:http://localhost:8080
  application:
    name: greet


4) Run the application and test it.

Redis Cache
============

1) What is Cache ?

2) Why we need to go for Cache ?

3) What is Redis ?

4) Spring Boot with Redis Integration 


=> Cache is a temporary storage

=> Cache will represent data in key-value format

=> By using Cache data, we can reduce no.of db calls from our application.

Note: DB call is always costly (it will take more time to execute)

=> By using Cache data (Cache Memory) we can increase performance of the application.

##### Redis Cache is one of the most famous Cache available in Market #####

=> The open source, in-memory data store used by millions of developers as a database, cache, streaming engine, and message broker.


=> Spring Boot provided below starter to communicate with Redis Server

				### springboot-starter-redis ###

=> We will use below components to communicate with Redis Server


1) JedisConnectionFactory : It represents connection with Redis Server

2) RedisTemplate : It provides methods to perform operations with Redis Server

3) OpsForHash: It is providing methods to peform operations based on Hash key

Working with Mono & Flux Objects
=================================

-> Mono & Flux objects are used to achieve reactive programming

-> Reacting Programming means Non-Blocking execution based on events

-> In Spring 5.x version Reactive Programming got introduced

-> To work with reactive programming Spring Boot provided below starter

			'spring-boot-starter-webflux'

-> Mono object represents single response

-> Flux object represents stream of responses
